                     DIRECTIONS FOR STARCHING MATS

New mats should be washed in mild soap flakes, rinsed and dried.

STARCH: Dissolve ¼ cup of starch in ½ cup of cold water. Cook slowly
over a low flame. As it thickens, stir in gradually about 1¼ cups cold
water. Cook, stirring constantly until the starch clears, 10 to 12
minutes. This makes a thick pasty mixture. As soon as starch is cool
enough to handle, dip mat and squeeze starch through it thoroughly.
Wring out extra starch. The mat should be wet with the starch, but there
should be none in the spaces. Pin mat in position according to size and
leave until thoroughly dry.

                           REMEMBER DYE LOTS

To insure the best results make certain that the “STAR” Brand Crochet
Cotton you buy to crochet your tablecloth is of one dye lot. The best
way to be sure of this is to purchase sufficient material at one time to
complete your piece. Or you can ask your dealer to reserve enough “STAR”
Brand Crochet Cotton for you.

                      WASHING AND BLOCKING CROCHET

Using hot water and a mild soap, make thick suds, add cold water until
suds are lukewarm.

Let the article stand in the suds a very few minutes, then squeeze in
and out until thoroughly clean. Rinse in clear water several times or
until sure the soap is removed. Roll in a bath towel. This will absorb
some of the moisture.

The work is now ready for blocking. Lay the work on a padded ironing
board or a flat surface and pin in position with rust proof pins,
stretching it gently to correct size and shape. Press through a damp
cloth and leave in position until dry.

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
