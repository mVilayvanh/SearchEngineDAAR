THE NEW MCGUFFEY FIRST READER





PREFACE

The New  McGuffey First Reader has been prepared in
conformity with the latest and most approved ideas regarding
the teaching of reading, and its lessons embody and illustrate
the best features of the word, the phonic, and the sentence or
thought methods.

While all the stories in this book are new, or have been
rewritten especially for its pages, care has been taken to
preserve the distinguishing characteristics which have given
to the McGuffey Readers their unparalleled popularity and
usefulness.

The gradation both in thought and in words has been carefully
maintained, and the work provided enables the pupils
to advance by easy and evenly progressive stages from the
beginning to the end.

Only a few new words are introduced at each lesson, and
these are repeated frequently in succeeding lessons until the
pupils are able to recognize them without difficulty.

From the first lesson script is presented in connection with
the printed forms of words, the frequency of its use diminishing
as the printed forms become more familiar.

The sounds of the letters are taught, in the order of the
alphabet, by appropriate exercises after the various reading
lessons. The phonic elements and the common diacritical
marks are learned one at a time and in a manner that is both
natural and easy.

My mother gave me a new book.

I took it to school one morning,
to let the girls see the pictures.

Soon after this I found my pet kitten
and took her home with me.

I like to play with my pet kitten.

I will do as mother says. I will
take good care of the kitten.

I love little Lucy. But now she has
gone far away to her home.

I like to see John run with his kite.

He can run as fast as the other boys,
but he can not jump far.

He does not like to look at books
and pictures, but he can play on a drum.

Some of the boys found it in the woods,

It was not in a nest.

Frank said; "I will take the little

It will be a good pet."

So Frank took it as he said.

He is kind to it and feeds it.

How very funny it must be to run

Will they find water on the hill?

Oh, yes, I see a well up there.

They must be good children to go
so far after a pail of water.

There must be good water in the well.

REVIEW.

One day Henry took a pail with
him and went up the hill.

Do you think he went to get a pail
of water? I do not think so.

He went to find violets and wild
flowers in the woods.

After a little he came down; but
he would not let me look in his pail.

He would not tell me how many
flowers were in it.

"Who will buy my wild roses?"
he said. "Who will buy my
sweet violets?

I came down the street to sell my
flowers. But now I must say
they do not sell very well."

sunflowers are good for?

Yes, they are good to look at.

If you will go to the field on the
hill, you may see many of them.

They are not sweet flowers, like
your violets and some others.

If you will give me one of your
pretty roses, you may have all
the sunflowers I can find.

I like roses and sweet violets.

I like to see big, yellow sunflowers,
too; but I do not care to take

birds, and the tall sunflowers,
and good children at school.

Soon you may take your book to school.

See this picture, Henry.

It is a picture of a little bird.

I think it is a yellow bird.

The bird has a pretty nest
in the woods.

Would you not like to see the little

By and by, they will come out and

But we do not care what you say.

We are too busy to think about it.

You must not keep us from our work.

What is as busy as a bee?

All day it sings as it works,

when warm walk these

One morning when the sun was
warm these children went out
to take a walk.

Do you know who they are?

I see May and Rose and little Lucy.

There are two other girls with them,
but I do not know their names.

They took a little wagon with them,
and went up the hill.

They went to the field on the hill to
find some violets.

They found some sunflowers in the
field, but violets do not grow there.

They saw a wild rose, but a busy
bee was on it.

"Now," said Lucy, "let us go to the
well and see if it has water in it."

"Yes," said one of the other girls,
"the sun is too hot here. But if
we go to the well, you must take
care not to fall in."

"Oh, I will not fall in," said Lucy.

"I will look at the water far
down in the well; but I will not fall."

The girls will go home when the sun
goes down.

These boys have been in the field
all the morning.

What do you think they do in the field?

They do not go out there to play.

They go to the field to work.

They help their father plant corn.

They are now on their way home.

One of the boys rides on the horse.

The other two walk behind.

Do you think that these boys like to work?

They will like to play when their
work is done.

Do you know what corn is?

Would you like to see how
it grows in the field?

This is the way it looks.

It is very green and pretty.

It grows to be as tall as

How much do you want for your

I will sell you the green ones
for three cents each. But I must
have more for these yellow ones.
They are sweet apples.

I think I must have four cents
each for these.

Oh, Frank! You want too much for
your apples. We can not buy them
to-day. We can not give so much.

Well, then, children, I will tell
you what I will do. I will give
you as  many apples as you want.

Thank you, Frank. You are  very
kind. Will you give one of your
sweet apples to each of us?

Yes, here are three apples for
each of you; and I have four to
take home to mother.

Can you tell how many apples
Frank has?

Is he not a good, kind boy to give
all his apples away?

Come, Henry, let us take a walk

would you like to go?

Shall we go to the green woods?

Or shall we go down to the field
and help the boys plant corn?

Tell me which way we shall go.

Oh, let us go out where the wild
flowers grow.

Then we can see the birds in the
trees, and the bees at their work.

Why do the bees fly from flower
to flower? Do they like to
work when the sun is warm?

Tell me why the bees are so busy

These four children have gone out
to see the sun set.

The sun is high in the sky now.

By and by it will set behind the hills.

The sun shines in the day time.

It helps to keep us warm.

It gives us light.

When it goes down we have night.

Then the stars come out and shine.

The moon shines at night, too.

But it is not so bright as the sun.

On some nights the moon does not
shine at all.

Do you like to see the moon?

Yes, I like to see it.

I like to see its pretty light.

We can look at the moon; but we
can not look at the sun.

It is too bright for us to look at.

Let us sit here in the shade under

You can look up and see the
green leaves and the little
green apples.

I should like to have one of the
apples. I wish you would get
it for me, Frank.

Why do you want it? It is not ripe.

All the apples on the tree are green,
and you must not eat them.

Do you see how little they are?

But the bright sun will shine on
them day after day.

They will grow and grow; and
after a time they will be
ripe, and yellow, and good to eat.

Then we will come and sit here in
the shade, and you may have
as many apples as you can eat.

It went into the flower for some

river fish   line hook near

One warm day in June, Frank's
father said to him: "Frank, I
think I will go down to the
river and catch some fish."

"Oh, father," said Frank, "I wish
I could go too. Will you let
me go and help you?"

"Yes, Frank. Run and; get your
hook and line."

"Thank you, father, I am so glad
that I may go."

Here is Frank at the river, with
his hook and line.

How bright the sun shines on the
water!

I wonder where all the fish have
gone. Frank can not see them.

The fish are far down in the water.

Frank has let his hook down, and
he wishes that a big fish would
come and take it.

But the fish do not wish him to
catch them to-day. They will
not come near the hook.

________________

blue place above among any saying

What a bright day this is!

The sky is as blue as it can be.

Lucy and her mother are in the woods.

They have found a good place under
a green tree.

They sit in the shade of the tree
and listen to the birds that are
singing above them.

Robin Redbreast is in the tree.

Lucy sees him as he jumps about
among the leaves.

By and by he will fly away to his nest.

Lucy wonders where it is.

boat oar row deep sometimes road house

John has a new boat.

His father gave it to him.

It is blue, with a bright red line
near the water.

He keeps it in the river, not far
from the road.

He has some good oars, too.

He keeps the oars at the house.

His home is near the river.

He likes to row up and down the
river in his boat.

Sometimes little May goes out in
the boat with him.

The water is not deep, and the
children will not fall out of the
boat. They like to row here
and there on the river.

John takes the oars, and May sits
in her place and tells him where
to go.

Sometimes each takes an oar. Then
the boat goes very fast.

John has a hook and line. But
when May is with him he does
not try to catch any fish.

Shall I tell you why?

He knows that May does not like
to see a fish on a hook.

REVIEW.

Here are all the boys coming up
the road. I wonder where they
are going to-day.

Each boy has a hook and a line,
and one has some light oars.

I think they are going to get into
John's new boat and row out
on the river.

Can you tell which of these boys
is John?

They will get in the boat and row
far out on the water.

When they get to a deep place they
will try to catch some fish.

I wonder if any of the fish will come
near the boat.

Little Robin Redbreast has a nest
in our garden.

If you listen any time in the day,
you can hear him sing.

On warm days he likes to sit in the
shade among the green leaves.

He can see the busy bees when they
fly to the flowers to get honey.

He sees the green apples about him,
but he does not like them. He
would not eat them if they
were ripe and sweet.

At night he can look up from his
place in the tree and see the
bright stars in the sky. Some
times he can see the moon, too,
as it shines above him.

Sometimes the Pussy Cat comes
under his tree and looks up at
him; but she can not get him.

She sits under the tree and wishes
that she could catch him.

Do you know why she wants the
bird? Do you know what she
would do if she could get him?

________________

One day Henry went out to the field
behind the garden. He went
out to see his father plant corn.

He sat down by a tree and said,
"Father, shall I help you work?
I have been in the house all day."

"Thank you, my little boy," said his
father. "I want some help very
much. What can you do?"

"I should like to plant some corn.
How much will you give me?"

"I will give you four cents a day
if you work well. But now
the sun is about to set, and we
must go home."

"What is that?" said Rose as she
went down the garden walk.

She saw Frank at work under
the apple tree.

"It is a little boat, Rose," said Frank.
"What do you think of this boat?"

"Oh, I think it is very pretty. Where
did you get it, Frank?"

"I made it, Rose. I made it all."

"How glad I am that you made it!
Will it float in the water?"

"I think so. All it wants now is the
sail. I will soon put that on."

"How I should like to see it sail!
Does mother know  that you
have made it?"

"Not yet; but I will take it to her
as soon as I have put the sail on it.

Then, if she will let us, we will take
it down to the river. We will
put it in the water and see it
float. We will see how fast it
can sail."

Soon Frank and Rose were on their
way to the river. Frank said
that if the boat sailed well, he
would give it to Rose.

She will let her doll sail in it.

"Yes, Henry, it is the wind.

We can hear it blow about the
house; but we can not see it.

If you should go out of the house,
you could feel it blow in your face."

"See how it blows the leaves about!
How fast Frank's little boat would

Do you know when summer comes?

When summer comes the days are
warm and bright.

Green leaves are on the trees.

Flowers bloom in the woods and
in the gardens.

The wind blows soft; the sky is
blue; the sun shines bright

In the summer the corn grows tall
and green. It is then that the
children play in the woods.

I like the summer time very much.

I wish my baby doll would wake.

Wake up, baby! Wake up!

Do not sleep so long.

It is morning, and all good little
dolls should be up.

Oh, baby, what a care you are!

Will you not wake up?

I do not know of any doll that
sleeps so long as you do.

Now jump up, and see what a bright
morning it is. See how the sun
shines. Wake up, baby!

Do you wish to know where I have
been, baby doll? I have been
down in the meadow with Frank
and Rose.

Shall I tell you what we saw?

Well, we saw birds and bees and
green leaves and pretty flowers.

Then we went to the river and
saw Frank's little boat sail on the water.

What will come when summer is
over and gone?

Oh, I can tell you. After the
summer is gone, fall will come.

When fall comes, the days begin
to grow cold.

Then the leaves fall from the trees.

Some of the leaves turn red, some
turn brown, and some turn
yellow as gold.

In the fall we have ripe apples to
eat. The corn is ripe then, too.

All the children are glad when fall
comes. Do you know why?

Play time is over, and school begins.

rain stay grass fresh

"I wish, mother, you would tell me
where the rain comes from.

"Does it come from the sky?

"Are the leaves and the flowers and
the grass glad when the rain
falls on them?"

This is what Lucy asked her mother
one day. Her mother said:

"The rain makes the grass look
green and fresh. It helps the
flowers grow.

"The corn which we plant in the
field could not grow if there
was no rain."

"But, mother," said Lucy, "I do not
like the rain very well. It
makes me stay in the house
when I want to go and play.

See how fast it rains! I shall have
to stay at home all day."

It is evening, and the sun is about to
set. The day will soon be gone.

Let us sit here on the soft grass
and look at the bright clouds
in the west.

Do you think there is any rain in
those little clouds?

Oh, no! Those are not rain clouds.

See how pretty they are!

Some of the clouds are red, and
some are as yellow as gold.

It is the light of the sun that makes
them look so bright.

Soon they will all fade away in the
blue sky.

Soon it will be night, and the moon
and stars will shine for us.

Here are four little girls who live
near the sea.

They have gone down to the
beach with their father.

They like to play in the sand.

Sometimes their mother goes with
them, and they stay there all day.

They like to look at the ships as
they sail far away on the blue sea.

Do you think you would like to
sail far away on a ship?

Sometimes these little girls find
pretty shells in the sand.

I think all children like to play
on the beach when the sun is warm,
and the wind does not blow.

What does the man say?

He says, "Good sweet apples,
only two cents each! Ripe, sweet
apples, yellow as gold! Who will
buy my apples this warm summer
morning?"

You can hear him as he goes
down the road. "Who wants to
buy a nice red apple?"

The apples are in the wagon.

The man walks in the road, behind
the wagon, and tells every one that
he has apples to sell.

His little dog rides in the wagon
and looks at the horse.

Is he not a funny driver?

The horse does not go very fast.

He knows that his driver can not
use a whip..

"Oh, who wants to buy some
good apples this bright summer
morning?"

________________

just hand told town brother

Do you know these three boys?

The tall boy in the wagon is
Frank Brown. The little boy is
Henry. He is Frank's brother.

The boy on the horse is John
Day. See how well he can ride!

Frank is a good driver. He sits
in the wagon, and the horse goes
just as he is told.

Frank has a whip in his hand,
but he does not use it.

Henry's little dog runs behind.
Sometimes he has to run very fast
to keep up with the wagon.

Do you know where the boys are
going?

I think they are going to town.

I wonder what they will buy in
town.

Henry says he will buy a book
with pretty pictures in it. He can
not read very well, but he likes to
look at books.

John wants to ride down to the
river and look at the boats. He
would buy a new boat if he could.
But he has only one cent, and what
can he buy with that?

Frank says they will not stay in
town long. They must go home
very soon.

The name of this little boy is
Robert. He is a busy boy.

He lives in a big town, and he
does not often see  the fields and
the green woods.

Yet he is just as happy as Frank
and John and little Henry.

He lives in a tall house not far
from the river. In the summer
time he can see the ships as they
sail up the river.

His father has a boat, and sometimes
Robert goes sailing in it.

One day Robert saw a man with
[Missing text] bows and arrows to sell.

"How much do you ask for your
arrows?" he said.

"[Missing text] three cents each," said the
man. "Would you like to buy one?"

Robert did not buy an arrow.

that was just as good.

Do you think he can use it?

What does the summer

It is then that we play in

winter north ice snow brings short shiver

When winter comes, the days are
short and the nights are long.

Then the cold north wind blows
over the fields and woods.

It blows over the meadow and
the river and the high hills.

It brings snow and ice.

It makes our hands and faces
cold. We do not like the north
wind.

All children are happy when winter
comes. They like to see the
snow. They like to play on the ice.

They do not care if the north
wind does make them shiver. Those
who are dressed warm do not feel
the cold very much.

Sometimes the snow is so deep
they can not go to school.

In the evening, they sit in the
warm house and read and play.

It is very cold to day, but the

The school room is warm and

You can see them at their places
in the school room.

They look out of the window and
see the snow falling. How soft and
white it is!

The teacher has been showing the
children some pictures in her new
book. Now she is telling them a

The children look and listen.
They do not think how cold it is

Can you tell what time it

then tell me.

The clock has a round face.

It has two hands.

We call the long hand the
minute hand, for it tells the
minutes.

We call the short hand the hour
hand, for it tells the hours.

How many hours are there in a
day? How many minutes in an hour?

If you listen, you can hear what the
clock says. Tick, tack, tick, tack.

Our clock at school tells us many
things.   It tells us when to work
and when to play.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
