PREFACE


The purpose of this work is to assist students of grenade work in
acquiring a rapid and complete knowledge of the subject. If the student
will refer constantly to the illustrations, which are accurate drawings
of grenades now in use, this book may help to elucidate many points
which are inadequately treated in any existing work.

In compiling the book, the author has inserted only information
absolutely necessary, and has arranged it so simply that a person with
a very little previous knowledge of the subject may be able to grasp
both the data given, and the principles, and methods herein explained
and illustrated.

This book is the result of practical experience in the present war.

                                                      G. M. AINSLIE.

HAND GRENADES


A grenade is a hollow ball, cylinder, or cube, made of metal or other
material, which is filled with some explosive, and burst by means of a
fuse, or on impact when it falls among an enemy. Until about the end
of the seventeenth century trained soldiers called Grenadiers used
grenades which were thrown by hand, but after that date they fell into
disuse. In 1899—1900 at the siege of Mafeking they are said to have
been used by the besieged, and also in the Russo-Japanese war. In the
year 1914, however, the beginning of the great war produced new methods
in the employment of infantry in the attack or defense of positions.
It was proved that under many conditions infantry armed only with a
rifle and bayonet found it impossible to press home an attack or hold a
position against troops armed with grenades.

This weapon, handy to use and immensely destructive and demoralizing in
its employment, has played a most important part in every successful
operation carried out by British troops on the Western front. It has
become one of the principal weapons not only in trench warfare, but in
the attack and clearing of enemy positions, strong points, villages,
and especially in house-to-house and cellar fighting.

      NOTE. 1. In throwing all hand grenades an overarm
    action will be used, like a bowler when playing cricket.

      2. Attached to all stick hand grenades are tapes or
    streamers a couple of feet long to enable them to fly head
    first, when thrown.

COMPOSITION OF A GRENADE SQUAD


In Line

    No. 1. Bayonet man.
    No. 2. Bayonet man.
    No. 3. First thrower.
    No. 4. Second thrower.
    No. 5. N.C.O. or Leader.
    No. 6. First carrier.
    No. 7. Second carrier.
    No. 8. Spare man.
    No. 9. Spare man or sniper.

In Single File

    No. 1. Bayonet man.
    No. 2. Bayonet man.
    No. 3. First thrower.
    No. 6. First carrier.
    No. 5. N.C.O. or Leader.
    No. 4. Second thrower.
    No. 7. Second carrier.
    No. 8. Spare man.
    No. 9. Spare man or sniper.

=Duties of Above.= _Nos. 1 and 2 Bayonet Man._ 1. _Clearing of a Trench
to a Flank._ They are the bodyguard for the thrower and carrier and
must always protect them under any conditions and at all costs.

      NOTE. The latter are not armed against attack at close
    quarters. The bayonet men work in advance of the thrower and
    carrier of their squads. They act as trench scouts; that is,
    they instruct their thrower and carrier how the trench runs and
    where the dug-outs and side trenches will be met. They will carry
    their rifles with bayonets fixed, loaded, magazine full. No. 3
    and 6 bomb and clear all dug-outs on the way down the trench. The
    first man throws the bomb, the bayonet man enters the dug-out and
    completes its work. At the junctions of communication trenches
    and side trenches they act as trench sentries and observers until
    relieved by the squads in rear. If necessity arises they assist
    the thrower by throwing bombs.

[Illustration: CLEARING A TRENCH FROM A FLANK.]

2. _Frontal Attack against Enemy Positions._ They will be in line with,
not in advance of the thrower and carrier and will protect them while
throwing by snap shooting, or with their bayonets against assault, or a
sudden rush by the enemy when at close quarters.

3. _Street Fighting and Village Cleaning._ They will keep down enemy
rifle fire by snap shooting, so as to enable the thrower to work close
enough to his objective to throw grenades, and when these have burst,
will go forward and complete their work.

_No. 3. First Thrower._ He throws grenades according to the directions
given him by his leader or by his bayonet men. He is a picked man,
steady under fire and chosen for his accuracy and length in throwing.

_No. 4. The Carrier._ He follows close enough in rear of the throwers
to keep them supplied with grenades, but must be careful not to crowd
them or impede the throwing. He will be prepared to instantly take up
the duties of the thrower should he become a casualty.

_No. 5. N.C.O. or Leader._ He is responsible for his squad and the
proper carrying out of the duties given to the squad. He will inspect
each man before an attack and see that he has his complete equipment
and that he knows the general idea and direction of the attack and
the final objective of his squad. He will be responsible for the
maintenance of supplies of grenades through his squad to the thrower,
and will supervise the automatic filling up of casualties in his squad
by men from the squads in the rear. He will indicate the position and
progress of his squad in the attack to supporting troops, etc., by
means of flags or other signals by day and by colored flares by night.

_Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9._ Their duties are the same as Nos. 1, 2, 3 and
4, and are to be considered primarily as carriers until otherwise
employed.

_No. 10. Spare Man._ He will act, if necessity arises, as leader of his
section, to clear side trenches, etc., and will instantly take over the
duties of No. 5 should he become a casualty.

_No. 11. Sniper._ He will act as a sniper by day and a connecting file
by night, between his own squad and the squad of troops in rear.

      NOTE. Every man in the grenade squad should be
    trained to fill the position of any other in the squad.

=Explanation of Chart No. A2.= The position occupied by grenadiers in
an attacking squad has this main point in consideration.

The safety and local protection of each individual in the squad; care
should be taken that as far as possible each man has a solid corner of
the trench close to him, which he can use as a protection against the
bursting effect of enemy grenades, by quickly advancing or retiring
around the corner.

The bayonet men are in advance of the thrower, close enough to protect
him, and not too far in front as to be in danger of being bombed by him.

The thrower—the actual means of attack—is protected in front by the
traverse and in the rear by the corner of the parados. The carrier is
close behind the thrower and is protected by two corners. The N.C.O. or
leader is where he can best watch the flight of the grenades thrown by
the throwers, and is also equally well protected.

=Method of Advance.= It is usually the endeavor to bomb and clear three
bays at a time in advance of the bayonet men. The N.C.O. reports the
throwing by the word “Mark,” to indicate a burst in the required bay.
On the third mark having been registered, the N.C.O. gives the order,
“Bayonet men report.” They immediately advance up the trench to the
last bay cleared and report back after examination either “All clear”
or “Enemy holding,” whereupon the N.C.O. gives the order “Advance,” or
directs the thrower to bomb the last bay again. This means of advance
is continued until the objective is gained.

=Island Traverse.= The two methods of attack are employed as shown on
the chart. It is imperative that the attack must not be allowed to be
held up, and should it be found impossible to advance down the trench
itself, owing to enfilade fire, the attack must be immediately launched
outside the trench, so as to attack the traverse from the rear, in the
case of a daylight attack.

=Precautions.= Care must be taken, especially by the bayonet men in
their advance through the trench, that enemy concealed trenches,
dug-outs, etc., are not left undiscovered. The sides of trenches and
the walls and floors of dug-outs should be carefully examined for
concealed entrances or exits.


FRONTAL ATTACK

IN CONJUNCTION WITH INFANTRY

=The Preparation Before an Attack.= The following details must be
carefully considered:

(_a_) The study of operation orders.

(_b_) The linking up of observations gained from the

    1. Study of existing trenches and aeroplane maps
       of enemy positions.

    2. The personal reconnaissance of the topographical
       features of the ground to be covered in the advance.

(_c_) The detailing of squads to their special objectives and the
arranging for work, carrying wire and demolishing parties for permanent
blocks at the final objectives.

[Illustration: FRONTAL ATTACK.]

(_d_) The kind of grenades to be used with a view to facilitating the
carrying of same.

(_e_) Carrying parties must be told off to insure supplies of grenades
reaching the throwers.

(_f_) Grenade depots must be built, sign boards arranged for, and
clearly marked “Grenade Depot” not only in our own system of trenches,
but also the positions told off beforehand where they are to be
established in the enemy trenches, or in =No Man’s Land= immediately
previous to the attack.

(_g_) Responsible officers and N.C.O.’s should be told off to look
after the grenade depots and supply of grenades.

(_h_) The position for infantry grenade dumps must be selected and
clearly explained to all units taking part in the attack, and special
parties told off to collect at these points and carry grenades to
nearest depots.

(_i_) A traffic system should be arranged and all men must be
acquainted with it, and the trenches or lines of travel clearly marked
“up traffic,” etc.

=The Advance.=

    =1. In line with infantry.=
    =2. In advance of infantry.=

No. 1 is the method adopted in daylight attack, the advance not being
covered by gas or smoke clouds.

No. 2 is method adopted in night attack and when weather conditions or
topographical features of ground covered in the advance allow it.

Attacking squads are allotted positions in lines of infantry
immediately opposite their first objectives, and on reaching these
positions should immediately commence bombing and clearing the trenches
towards their final objectives. In the case of No. 1 the infantry
clears the main trench, but special grenade parties may be told off to
assist the infantry in this work, especially when strong points occur
in the enemy position.

It is most important that all infantry taking part in an attack should
be previously supplied with grenades and this must be considered the
first source of supply. Positions designated as infantry grenade
dumping positions should be chosen and known to the infantry at which
they dump their grenades in their advance on the enemy positions. These
positions should be close to the position to be captured and held.

In order to hold positions captured from the enemy it is imperative
that grenade storming parties hold their final objectives at all costs,
and until the positions to be permanently held have been consolidated.




TRENCH STORMING PARTIES


Trench storming parties should kill or drive back the hostile occupants
of a trench as quickly as possible, clear as much of the enemy trench
as has been ordered, and then hold the portion cleared with as small
loss as possible to themselves. It must be remembered that in trench
clearing, and especially in deep and narrow trenches, only the head of
the attacking party can directly kill, and seldom more than one man
can throw at a time. Therefore it is essential that a constant supply
of grenades reaches the thrower and that the places of casualties are
automatically filled by reinforcements. Men must be trained until they
can do this either by day or at night time.

=Advance.= Movement is rapid until contact with the enemy is obtained.
Once contact is established it must be maintained and pressed home.
A retreating enemy must be given no time to re-establish a defensive
attitude, corners must be worked carefully and bays and straight
pieces of trench rushed. The bayonet men will complete the work of
the grenades and see that the carrier and thrower will meet with no
opposition on their way to new throwing position. The effect of a
grenade bursting in a confined space like a trench is tremendous, and
though it may not kill it will stun or shock the hostile occupants, and
if the bayonet men follow up rapidly they will meet with very little
resistance.

=Casualties.= Every man must be trained to take up the duties of any
other man in his squad. They do not necessarily keep to their own
squads; the squads in rear of the attacking squad may be looked on as
a reserve squad for the one in front. Thus, Casualty first squad. The
thrower No. 3 is reinforced by the first thrower of the second squad,
and so on.

=Side Trenches.= When a side trench is met with, the leading squad will
go up and clear it. The second half will remain at the junction until
first returns, then the second squad will continue advance in original
direction of the attack.

=Blocking and Barricades.= For blocking captured trenches, etc., see
Manual of Field Engineering, Wire Entanglements, Hurdles, etc.




FOREIGN GRENADES. FRENCH


The description of British and German grenades apply also to those
grenades used by the French army. They are:

    1. Three kinds of petards.

      NOTES. 1. Fuse burns 5 seconds.
      2. These grenades are always carried alive.
      3. A special ring or striking box is provided to light the fuse.

=Foreign Hair Brush Grenades.= They are similar to the British No. 12
Hand Grenades.




GERMAN GRENADES


There are two types:

No. 1. Service grenades.

No. 2. Improvised or home-made grenades.

These are again divided into two classes:

=A.= Those that depend for their effect upon fragmentation on
detonation.

=B.= Those that depend for their effect upon the shock of detonation
only.

The type =B= is more commonly met with than type =A=. Ignition is by
time or percussion. The time of fuses about six seconds burning.

=Precautions.= When handling foreign grenades care should always be
taken and the following rules should be enforced:

    1. Only skilled grenadiers should be allowed to examine
       and handle any grenades found.
    2. Grenade depots when discovered should be immediately
       reported to the nearest grenadier.
    3. Foreign time grenades should be thrown as soon
       as the lighting device has been started.

Description of German Grenades

[Illustration: RIFLE GRENADES.]




EXPLOSIVES USED IN GRENADES


Explosives are divided into two classes:

    1. Low explosives.
    2. High explosives.

To the first group belong all propellant explosives, i.e., all powders,
such as gunpowder and smokeless powders used in firearms.

To the second group belong:

    (_a_) All explosives used in shells, torpedoes,
    grenades, demolitions, etc.

    (_b_) Detonators or exploders, i.e., explosives which
    start explosive reactions in the explosives of Group (_a_).

=The characteristic of H.E.= is the extreme violence and suddenness of
their detonation.

In order to make them instantly pass from a solid or liquid form to
gas, they require a detonator or exploder, which applies a violent
shock to them and breaks down the chemical structure of the explosive
compound, and enables the flame to pass instantaneously throughout the
mass of the compound. This explosive is known as detonation.

=The composition of H.E.= almost without exception is some organic
substance, usually some form of carbon combined with nitrogen. Nitrogen,
one of the most inert gases known, owes its explosive value to this
very inertness; it combines so very reluctantly that on the least
provocation—such as shock—the compound of which it forms a part
instantly breaks up into gas, giving the enormous expansion needed for
explosive effect.

=Ammonal.= A gray powder. An Austrian explosive, picric acid plus
T.N.T. plus aluminum powder plus nitrate of ammonia plus carbon.

A very safe explosive—will not detonate when struck by rifle bullet,
but is very hygroscopic (collects moisture) and when in this condition
is liable not to detonate.

=Ballistite.= Consists of guncotton plus camphor or vaseline. Invented
by Nobel in 1888.

=Cordite.= Consists of nitro-glycerine 55 parts, plus guncotton 37
parts, plus vaseline 5 parts, plus acetone to harden, invented by Sir
W. Abel.

=Benzol.= Or Benzine, used extensively as a motor fuel contains a fair
percentage of toluene. (See T.N.T.)

=Coal Tar.= When subjected to fractional and low-temperature
distillation produces many by-products valuable in the making of H.E.
These distillations give off “light” and “heavy” oils of coal tar.

=Donnerite.= High explosive employed by German army in grenades.

=Dynamite.= See Nitro-glycerine.

=Fulminate of Mercury.= See Mercury.

=Guncotton=, or nitro-cellulose consists of cotton waste, purified,
dried, and heated with mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric
acid. Washed and reduced to a pulp and moulded into 1 oz. primers and
15 oz. slabs for service use. Is considered inferior to lyddite.

Size of wet slab of G.C., 6 × 3 × 1⅜ in.

Wet guncotton will not explode if hit by a bullet.

Wet guncotton can be sawn by a wet saw.

Requires dry primer, detonator and fuse to explode.

Dry guncotton will explode if hit by a bullet.

Dry primer of guncotton 1.35 in. diam., 1.15 in. diam. at ends, and
1.25 in. high.

Strength, 2½ times stronger than gunpowder, unconfined. Strength, 7 to
8 times stronger than gunpowder, confined.

Invented by Schombein in 1846.

=Gunpowder.= A mechanical mixture.

Saltpeter 75 per cent, plus charcoal 15 per cent, plus sulphur 10 per
cent. Rate of burning depends upon firmness of powder.

=Lyddite=, or picric acid. Consists of melted and solidified picric
acid. Vaseline is used to melt it. (See Picric Acid.)

=Mercury Fulminate.= Is made by dissolving three parts mercury in
36 parts nitric acid, keeping mixture at low temperature, and when
dissolved adding 17 parts of alcohol.

A small quantity of F. of M. placed on top of T.N.T. forms an excellent
detonating mixture. A great many German detonators consist of this.
Discovered by Howard in 1800.

=Melinite.= A French H.E., very similar to lyddite. Is picric acid
mixed with collodion. Introduced by Eugene Turpin.

=Nitro-glycerine.= Is produced by the action of nitric acid and
sulphuric acid on glycerine. Invented in 1847. When pure is a colorless
liquid. Explodes when heated to about 360° F.

N.G. in liquid form too dangerous to be used in practice. Was absorbed
in porous solid by Nobel in 1867 as dynamite. Porous solid used either
=kiesulguhr= or =fullers’ earth= used in percussion caps.

    Relative strength   150 equals maximum
    Blasting glycerine  150
    Gelatine dynamite   130
    Gelignite           110
    Dynamite            100
    Carbonite            55

=Picric acid.= A yellow crystalline prepared from coal tar. A
by-product of gas manufacture. The “heavy oil” of coal tar is boiled
and chemically treated, resulting in phenol or carbolic acid, which
separates from it. Carbolic acid is boiled sulphuric acid, and nitric
acid is carefully added, resulting in picric acid.

It is a very safe explosive and very powerful. Its chief fault is that
it forms “picrates” with metals or acid salts, some of which are more
sensitive to disturbing influences than the acid itself. To overcome
this the inside of all shells are varnished.

Pressure of picric acid equals 135,820 lb. on the square inch.

=Shimose.= Japanese H.E. Similar to lyddite.

=T.N.T.=, or tri-nitro-toluene or Toluol, largely used in German army
and navy. Is produced by heating toluene with mixture of nitric and
sulphuric acid.

Less powerful than lyddite, but is more stable and does not form
“picrates” and is not affected by water or air. Will not explode if hit
by a bullet.

Pressure T.N.T. equal to 119,000 lbs. per square inch.

=Tolite.= French name for T.N.T.

=Trilite.= Spanish name for T.N.T.

=Trotyl.= German name for T.N.T.

=Toluene=, or Toluol. Experiments made in 1899 at Karlsruhe produced
about seven pints of toluene from one ton of coal. The modern process
of low-temperature distillation of coal, however, greatly increases
quantity that can be obtained from each ton.

Is an aromatic colorless liquid hydrocarbon.

=Turpinite.= French H.E. similar to Melinite.

=Tetryl.= A coal tar product containing more nitrogen than T.N.T. or
lyddite. When mixed with a lead oxide it makes a less sensitive and
safer preparation than fulminate of mercury for detonators.




=FUSES=


=SERVICE FUSE=

=No. 11 Safety or Time Fuse=

=Description.= Color, black. Smooth surface.

=Time of Burning.= One foot in thirty seconds.

=Composition.= Train of slow match inside a wrapping of hemp or flax,
covered by layer of gutta-percha, surrounded by binding of black
waterproof tape.


=INSTANTANEOUS OR QUICK FUSE=

Color, red. Ribbed surface.

=Time of Burning.= Eighty feet per second.

=Composition.= Same as service fuse, except that it contains quick
match in place of slow match.

=Caution.= Instantaneous fuse must never be stored alongside safety
fuse.




=DETONATORS=


=SERVICE=

=No. 8 Mark VII=

=Description.= Copper tube open at one end painted red, marked on white
label, No. 8. M.K. VII containing 32 grs. fulminate of mercury.


=COMMERCIAL (Long)=

=COMMERCIAL (Short)=

=Description.= Copper tube, open one end, containing 25 grs. fulminate
of mercury.




=EXPLODERS=


=SERVICE=

=Guncotton.= One-oz. primer, 15-oz. slab. See Explosives, Guncotton.

=No. 2 Detonator for Hand Grenade.= Consists of brass tube (detonator
holder) with flat screw head. The other end is fitted with a cavity
which carries N.G. percussion cap. A commercial detonator open end
toward the screw head is placed inside, its open end closed with a
wooden plug; the closed end is pierced with four flash holes to enable
flash from percussion cap to communicate with F. of M. in detonator. A
brass screw in head of detonator holder closes detonator tube.

This detonator has three screw threads.

=No. 3 Detonator.= See description of No. 2. This detonator is ¼ in.
longer than No. 2, and has two screw threads.


=PATENT LIGHTERS=

=Nobel Lighter.= (See Plates 8 and 9.) The lighter is made up of two
cardboard tubes, one fitting over the other; inside the end of the
larger tube is a small brass cap containing friction composition. At
the top of the smaller tube are two friction points. These points are
held about ¼ in. from the cap containing friction composition, by a
safety pin passing through both tubes. At the other end of the smaller
tube is a small copper band into which the fuse can be crimped. A
narrow band of waterproof tape with a loose end is glued around the
joint of the two tubes to keep out moisture.

=To Assemble.= Insert fuse into lighter, fasten by crimping, and insert
other end of fuse into detonator. The joints at lighter and detonator
should be waxed to make it damp-proof and flash-proof.

=Brock Lighter.= See Grenade Hand. Consists of a small cardboard cup
filled with friction composition, covered with waterproof paper. The
latter can be torn off by pulling a small tag which is left free.

Grenades with fuses are so arranged (with sufficient length of fuse)
to explode from 3 to 5 seconds after being ignited and thrown, giving
the thrower plenty of time (when throwing from a trench) to bend down
safe. Grenades, without fuses (but with detonators only) will explode
on impact; for instance, in Grenade No. 1, Mark I, it is obvious when
instructions (see p. 2, Grenade 1) are carried out, and grenade is
thrown, that the steel needle will be driven into the detonator and
exploded.

In Grenade No. 3, Mark I, when safety pin is removed and releasing
socket slipped back, the wind vane revolves backward (during the
passage through the air) until far enough to allow the retaining
bolt to fall out. This leaves nothing between the firing needle and
detonator cap except a very thin spiral spring which is only strong
enough to hold the weight of the needle pellet until the shock of
impact when the grenade explodes.

In Grenade No. 20 releasing collar slips back on the rifle being fired.

In Grenade No. 5, Mark I. On this grenade being thrown the pressure
of the fingers being released the striking lever flies outward by the
pressure of the powerful spring, releasing the shoulder of the firing
striker which is driven on to the fuse and explodes in 4½ seconds.

All other grenades, see pages opposite plates.




=THROWING=


Hand grenades are held firmly in the hand behind the thrower, the arm
is brought quickly upward with a sweeping movement (the arm straight
all the time), the grenade will be let go when the hand is above the
thrower’s head, and should describe a semicircle in its flight.

Hand grenades can be thrown from 30 to 50 yards, rifle grenades from
200 to 400 yards.

Attacks should be practiced with dummy and deteriorated grenades, i.e.,
grenades with only a detonator and no explosive, etc.

Confidence and knowledge of grenades should be gained by students
handling, stripping and assembling all types and handling fuses and
detonators, as often as possible.

The importance of grenade work cannot be over-estimated and one can
imagine numberless cases when a grenade is more useful than any
other weapon. For instance, in street fighting a number of the enemy
are holding a house and firing from an upper window commanding the
main approach. You cannot get at them with a rifle, but it might be
comparatively easy for one or two men to get along to the house by back
ways, using the other houses for shelter and throw a grenade through
the window, killing everyone in the room.

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
