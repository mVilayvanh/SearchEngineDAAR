                                 of the
                  American Bureau of Engineering, Inc.


The phenomenal growth of this Institution is due to the fact that it
has, from the start, anticipated the needs for authoritative information
and adequate shop equipment to take care of the ELECTRICAL side of the
automotive and allied industries.

It has four active divisions:

         1. A Bureau of Electrical Engineering, consulted by
              automobile manufacturers, dealers and by technical schools
              and colleges throughout the world.

         2. A Publishing House, employing the highest
              authorities to compile text books and Ready Reference
              Manuals relating to the electrical equipment of
              Automobiles, Trucks, Tractors, and Farm Lighting Plants.

         3. A Manufacturing and Sales Organization for
              supplying up-to-date shop equipment to the Battery and
              Electrical Service Stations.

         4. An Electrical School, operating this branch under
              the name of “AMBU ENGINEERING INSTITUTE.” This school is
              conducted so that a student can attend classes in Chicago,
              or complete instruction in Automotive Electricity can be
              obtained in the Home Study Course.

                         Mr. Battery Repairman


Before reading the following pages, Mr. Batteryman, just stop a few
minutes and take a good look around your shop. You know your business,
certainly or you would not have a shop, but are you operating in a way
to make the greatest profit?

When you stop to think it over, are not some of your methods rather
crude? Haven't you often thought, when you were doing some disagreeable
job, that there ought to be a better and quicker way? Haven't you often
wished that you knew how to turn that rapid accumulation of “junk” parts
into real money?

The American Bureau of Engineering is not trying to tell you how to run
your business, but we are trying to help you realize a greater profit by
showing you some “better” methods.

Lead moulding is but one of many ways that spare time and material,
usually junked, can be turned into profit.

Every piece of equipment we mention has been carefully developed in our
own shop, every method recommended is one which we have found, by actual
experience to be best for the purpose described.

A strict observance of the instructions will save you all the
experimenting we have done and save you many disappointments. If for any
reason our instructions do not produce the results you think they
should, remember it is a pleasure for our Engineers to help you solve
your personal difficulties.

                           Profits From Scrap


In his every day work, the storage battery service man must deal chiefly
with three materials, wood, rubber and lead.

The wooden parts, such as boxes and separators are pretty well
standardized, can be purchased at reasonable prices and are used solely
for replacements. It would not pay the battery man to equip his shop to
manufacture any of these items.

[Illustration: Figure 1]

The same is true of the rubber parts, the jars and top covers. A dozen
different sizes in stock will take care of nearly all the various makes
and models of batteries which come in for repair.

With the lead parts, however, the conditions are entirely different. All
the active and wearing parts are made of lead, or its compounds, and
practically every battery that needs repair, needs some of them
replaced. Then again there is a much greater variety in the design of
these parts and the up-to-date shop, in order to give real service, must
carry a large assorted stock of end connectors, connector straps, plate
straps and posts.

In speaking of lead parts, however, the plates are to be considered on
the same basis as the rubber parts or wooden boxes, because it would not
pay the ordinary battery shop to try and cast grids, mix paste and
manufacture plates. It is much more satisfactory to purchase plates made
by a responsible manufacturer who has the facilities and capital to
properly develop his formulae and processes.

Every battery that has to be opened must have the top connectors drilled
off as in Fig. 1, which naturally makes a lot of lead chips. These
drillings have to be cleaned off before proceeding with the repair and
can, with no loss of time, all be collected, as in Fig. 2, and saved.
Then the old sulphated end connectors and parts from “junked” batteries
accumulate very fast.

[Illustration: Figure 2]

This then is the situation—The battery service station is constantly in
need of new lead parts. Should they be obtained from a manufacturer at a
price that includes material, labor and the manufacturer's
profit—OR—should equipment be purchased that will permit of moulding
these same parts from the accumulated scrap lead at a cost of nothing
but the time employed in pouring, with no cost for material and no
“Profits” added?

No matter how cheap you think you are buying your lead parts, just
compare the market price per pound on lead with the weight of a few of
your “cheapest” ones.

It is now common practice to melt some of this accumulation of scrap
lead and pour it into sticks or bars for use in lead burning on repair
work. A great amount, especially old groups, is generally sold at a low
price in order to get it out of the way. The one important fact, and one
generally overlooked, is, that the battery man who melts lead and moulds
it into sticks for lead burning, certainly is able to melt the same
metal and mould it into the lead parts he requires, provided, of course,
that he has the proper moulds.

Many a wide awake man has whittled a wooden mould for some part that he
wanted in a hurry and couldn't wait for the manufacturer to deliver.
Naturally this condition, really an effort to render service to the
customer, created a demand for moulds of a permanent character.

In an effort to supply this demand, the moulds that have been produced
were all made for some individual part, were light in weight and easily
became overheated, making them hard to handle and often burning the
workman's hands.

[Illustration: Figure 3]

From a business standpoint, it would certainly be mighty profitable for
a battery shop to be able at a moment's notice, to convert junk lead
into new salable parts. In addition to the large profit from the sale of
these new parts, another good feature, is that, instead of tieing up a
lot of capital in stock, the new parts can be made as needed, without a
cent of investment.

From a service standpoint, it is a cheaper and faster process to cast a
new top connector than to spend a lot of valuable time, whittling an old
one so that it can be used again.

How much time have you or your men wasted cleaning up an old terminal as
in Fig. 3, so that you could burn it on again?

All new connectors and terminals put on a rebuilt or reinsulated job
make the customer feel that he is getting a real repair. He sees a new
finished job.

From an electrical standpoint, the new parts mean better work, because
better burning can be done, certainly a new connection will allow the
battery to deliver more current than an old partly sulphated one could
ever do.


                    CAN YOU MAKE GOOD LEAD CASTINGS?

The question that naturally comes up is, can the ordinary battery man
make good lead castings? We will answer “Yes,” very emphatically. There
is nothing mysterious about the work and all the talk of alloys,
compounds and formulae does not mean a great deal.

Pure lead is not hard or rigid enough to make good battery parts,
therefore, it is necessary to add some other metal that will provide the
strength, not be affected by the acid and not increase the resistance
electrically. Antimony has all the necessary qualities, and is,
therefore, commonly used by mixing it with the pure lead.

[Illustration: Figure 4]

The various manufacturers recommend from 2 to 12 percent antimony, as
the proper combination, but in buying new pig lead for castings, a 4
percent antimony compound is very satisfactory.

In using old battery lead, however, due to chemical action the
proportion of antimony is apt to be too high to produce perfect
castings. This usually shows up by cracks or shrinkage, as in Figure 4.
To overcome this trouble, pure lead is added, until a perfect casting is
made. Pure lead can be purchased (in the form of bars, lead pipe, or
sheet lead) from a manufacturer such as the National Lead Company—your
accessory jobber, the local plumber, or the junk dealer. When buying
from a junk dealer, however, care =must= be taken that there is no
solder or tin present.


                        PREPARATION OF THE LEAD

In order to pour the lead some means of melting and a proper container
must be provided.

As pure lead melts at about 620°F., and antimony at 785°F., an ordinary
gas flame will furnish sufficient heat. For the small shop, without an
artificial gas supply, a plumber's furnace which can be secured from
Hardware Jobber or Plumber Jobber will work satisfactorily. See page 19
for gas melting pots.

An ordinary cast iron solder pot will be found the most suitable
container. It should be about 8 inches in diameter.

It is advisable to obtain as large a pot as above, because for steady
pouring a sufficient supply of melted metal should always be available.
Then too, the constant addition of scrap or pig lead in a small pot will
often change the proportion of antimony so that the castings crack and
have to be melted over again.

Wash the pot thoroughly with gasoline or kerosene to remove all traces
of oil. Then after it has been carefully dried, put it over the flame
and heat it gradually. Do this before putting in any lead.

The only other equipment necessary to handle the melted lead is a ladle.
For this purpose a malleable iron melting ladle five inches in diameter
should be purchased. It can be used for stirring, skimming and pouring,
and the type with a spout, illustrated in Fig. 5 will be found most
suitable. The ladle should be cleaned and treated exactly like the
melting pot.

[Illustration: Figure 5]

The scrap or pig lead can now be put in the pot and melted. It is a time
saving plan to pick out carefully all the pieces of wood, rubber and
sealing compound from the scrap lead before it is put in the pot. Old
plates are not worth while melting, but a lot of good lead can be
salvaged by sawing the strap and post off old groups. Above all things
make sure that no wet parts or moisture of any kind ever gets into the
lead pot.


                           CLEANING THE LEAD

As the lead melts most of the dross or dirt will come to the top and
float. When all the pieces are melted stir the lead with the ladle and
then skim off all the dirt.

To help the cleaning process a piece of paraffin can be dropped into the
pot. After it has burned, the dross is more easily skimmed off.

Another method of cleaning is to add to every ten pounds of metal, one
teaspoonful of equal parts of powdered rosin, borax and flour of
sulphur. Stir this compound in a little and when the lead is at the
proper temperature there will be a flare, flash or a little burning. A
sort of tinfoil popcorn effect will be noticed floating on top of the
metal. Continue stirring until this melts down and then skim off the
soft particles.

An easy way to test the temperature of the melted lead is to insert the
end of a pine stick for a moment. When the wood blackens or burns, the
lead is hot enough to pour.

Whenever the lead is in melted form and exposed to the air, as in the
iron pot, there will be a slight oxidation take place which appears as a
yellowish-red scum. Do not confuse this with the dross and dirt which is
to be skimmed off, but if the scum gets thick, then skim it off before
pouring any of the metal.


                          PREPARING THE MOULD

One of the greatest difficulties in making lead castings has been to get
the metal to completely fill the mould. There are several reasons for
this, but they can easily be overcome.

If the mould, which is generally made of iron, is very cold, it will
chill the melted lead and cause it to become solid before it has reached
all parts.

The surface of a cast iron mould is very porous, and the melted lead,
partially entering the pores of the iron, is held back long enough to
chill and set.

To remedy these faults, it is sometimes advisable to heat the mould in
order to get perfectly shaped castings.

To close the pores of the iron moulds they are sometimes “smoked” with a
flame like that of “Prest-O-Lite” gas or else dusted with graphite.

[Illustration: Figure 6]

The AMBU mould compound has been developed to eliminate the necessity
for heating or smoking the mould—it remedies all the pouring troubles
and in addition, has chemical ingredients that aid in preventing the
mould from rusting. AMBU mould compound is placed in a little sack,
contained in each can, and the surface of the mould dusted with the
sack, as shown in Figure 6.

The compound completely fills the pores of the iron, produces perfect
castings with a cold mould and prevents the finished part from sticking.
It does not wear off as quickly as the “smoke,” and dusting from time to
time, while castings are being made will produce a high polish on the
mould surface which will result in even better castings.

The mould in Figure 6 is the new AMBU Washburn combination link mould,
which casts 15 parts, being reversible much like the ordinary “waffle
iron.” The side being “dusted” casts four top connectors of different
lengths.


                            POURING THE LEAD

Placing the mould as in Figure 7, the lead is poured in the four
openings until the metal projects slightly above the top.

To pour properly first skim the dross as previously explained, then with
the ladle, push the film of oxide away and dip into the clean pure lead.
Pour steadily until the mould is filled and the metal projects slightly
above the top. As it cools there will be quite a little contraction
which takes up most of the excess lead.

[Illustration: Figure 7]

=Never=, under any conditions, stop pouring with a mould partially
filled. Always be sure there is enough melted lead in the ladle to
completely fill the mould, before starting to pour.

The mould can now be easily opened by pulling on the handles especially
if it has been properly dusted with the Ambu Mould Compound.

After the mould is opened, Figure 8, the castings are easily removed,
without damage to either the mould or the casting proper. The workman
does not, at any time, handle the hot parts of the mould or the hot
castings.

[Illustration: Figure 8]

The mould weighs 25 pounds, and is large enough to absorb sufficient
heat to allow continuous pouring without becoming overheated. It is
solid enough to be used without the need of a vise.


                         IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

In all lead moulding, there are several important points to remember:

1. Never put anything in the lead pot that is not perfectly dry. A few
drops of water in a pot of melted lead will cause an explosion and the
hot lead will be thrown all over the shop burning and perhaps blinding
the workman.

2. Have all moulds clean and dry.

3. Keep the melted lead in the lead pot clean at all times.

4. Always completely fill each mould at one pouring.

5. Dust moulds well with Ambu mould compound before pouring.

6. When castings “shrink” and crack, add pure lead to that in the pot
until the trouble is remedied.

7. Be sure melted lead is of proper temperature, by pine stick test,
before starting to pour.

8. Remove castings as soon as they set, to prevent the mould from
becoming too hot.

9. A perfect casting, that breaks when taken out of the mould, has
probably not been allowed sufficient time to “set” or cool properly.

10. Never use a hammer on the surface of the mould. If a casting should
stick, pry it out.


                      AMBU COMBINATION LINK MOULD

Using both sides, this mould casts five of the most used connectors for
all batteries, using Standard Jars, 7-9-11-13-15 Plate four end
connectors (two Dodge Tapers and two Standard Tapers, Negative and
Positive), one end connector, ⅜-inch wire leed used on 12-volt Maxwell
and other cars using wire leed. One small wire leed to connect with end
post on storage battery requiring direct connection. Post support rings,
which fit the two sizes standard rubber covers; also fit perfectly all
posts cast with our post mould. Two handy washers that sometimes are
badly needed when installing a new or rent battery.

[Illustration: Figure 8A[1]]

Extra taper plugs can be furnished, also extra bushings for different
size cable. Standard equipment as furnished includes four taper plugs,
one large and one small cable bushing.

The top connectors most frequently replaced are the taper end
connections and end connections with wire cable leads. For battery men
desiring these parts, but not the large combination link mould, the
AMBU-Washburn terminal mould, Figure 9, has been designed. It has the
same general good features of the larger mould, and casts four end
connectors, one wire cable leed and two washers.

[Illustration: Figure 9[1]]


                         AMBU POST STRAP MOULD

Perhaps the most expensive item of a stock in a battery station, is the
supply of positive and negative groups. While two or three sizes of
plates will fit practically every battery, each size battery requires a
different size of group.

[Illustration: Figure 10[1]]

The AMBU-Washburn Post Strap Mould has been developed in order that a
comparatively small stock of plates can be instantly available for
making any size of group. You will notice in Figure 10, that the same
features, as those of the link mould of Figure 8 are used, namely; a
large substantial base, no need of handling hot parts and the easy
removal of castings. All parts of the moulds are carefully machined to
produce perfect castings and the patented movable tooth rack will make
odd or even numbers of teeth on the post strap. The teeth are correctly
spaced for all standard batteries, or by reversing the tooth rack, blank
posts can be cast.

Two bushings, bored and reamed for standard size posts, are furnished,
but special bushings are available making it possible to cast any type
of post strap.


                    AMBU PRODUCTION POST STRAP MOULD

For the large shop or manufacturer, the AMBU-Washburn Post Strap Mould,
is made with the special indexing feature of Figure 11. This is easily
adjustable and will cast straps of both odd and even numbers of teeth
for 7 to 19 plate groups. Otherwise its construction and appearance is
the same as Figure 10.

Both of these moulds are made for real use and will turn out three
perfect castings per minute. This unusual speed can be maintained
because the castings are easily removed. In Figure 10, the upper part of
the mould is resting on a part of the handle made for that purpose and a
slight blow on a hardwood stick, on the top of the post, will drop the
casting instantly.

[Illustration: Figure 11[1]]


                       AMBU CELL CONNECTOR MOULD

The AMBU-Washburn Cell Connector Mould is a combination mould which will
cast practically all of the cell connectors used on standard storage
batteries, 7-11-13 and 15 plate, such as the Exide, Willard, U. S. L.,
Vesta, Philadelphia and other nationally known batteries. Its design is
similar to our Link Combination Mould.

Made of fine gray iron, carefully machined. Castings are easily removed,
and it is heavy enough so that it will not overheat where speed is
required.

[Illustration: Figure 12]

After re-insulating or repairing, the job looks more complete and
satisfactory to your customer if the battery is furnished with a new set
of connectors. Use your scrap lead and make new connectors for each job.
It pays.


                            AMBU SCREW MOULD

The lead capped screws of the taper type terminal are another of the
frequently replaced parts. Although the round knurled head type is no
longer installed, a great many men still use pliers on the square head
terminal screws with the result that the soft square lead head is
damaged to such an extent that a tight connection cannot be made.

The AMBU-Washburn Screw Mould, Figure 13, will cast standard square
edged heads on four screws in one operation, two ^5⁄_{16}-inch and two
⅜-inch. It has screw adjustments in the base, making it adaptable to any
length screw.

[Illustration: Figure 13[1]]

As the finished screws are removable from the top, the position of the
mould is not changed while in use and castings can be made at the rate
of 12 screws a minute.


                         AMBU LEAD STICK MOULD

In order to properly burn in and assemble the new lead parts, it is
necessary that they be fused and new lead added, and this requires that
a supply of lead sticks be available. These are usually made by melting
the smaller particles of scrap and junk lead which is cast in convenient
size.

The Ambu Mould, Figure 14, is especially designed for this purpose. It
is made of heavy sheet iron, die stamped into grooves and mounted on a
wooden base with a strong wooden handle at one end. A heavy pad of
asbestos is placed under the iron to protect the wood.

[Illustration: Figure 14[1]]

This construction allows the lead to completely fill the grooves before
cooling, but prevents the mould from becoming exceedingly hot with
constant pouring. A pair of these moulds will keep one workman busy, as
he pours one, the other is cooling. This eliminates all waiting and
waste of time.

The sticks made are 15 inches long, ^5⁄_{16} inch thick, ⅜ inch wide at
the top and ¼ inch at the bottom. In pouring in an open mould of this
type, pour the lead in each groove at one end, so that the dross will
all gather in one spot. Never move the ladle along the groove when
pouring, as this will scatter the dross and make the entire stick dirty.

When poured at one end only, a short length of the stick may be broken
off, thus removing all the dross.

Dusting the mould occasionally with Ambu mould compound will produce
better castings and permit greater speed in the work.


                        AMBU PLATE BURNING RACK

The building of groups, even after the plates and post straps are
secured is a job that requires quite a lot of skill. Before the plates
can be burned to the strap, they must be absolutely parallel, must be
the correct distance apart, and the top surface of the strap must be at
right angles to the surface of the plates.

The Ambu Plate Burning Rack, Figure 15, has been designed to easily
secure the proper conditions. It consists of a wooden base with six
different sets of slots properly spaced which cares for 98% of the
batteries on the market. The guide bar or “comb” on top is slotted to
match up with the base. (See figure 15.)

[Illustration: Figure 15[1]]

The positions of the base and comb are so arranged that the plates are
securely held on opposite corners, at exactly the right distance apart
and are absolutely straight and parallel.

The wooden base prevents the plate proper from coming in contact with
any metal and thus eliminates any possibility of later trouble due to
impurities in the cell.

[Illustration: Figure 16[1]]

In order to accommodate the different sizes and spacings, the comb can
be adjusted vertically and the slots are arranged in groups of different
spacings. These adjustments are flexible enough to allow the setting up
of practically all the various groups used in the different makes and
type of batteries.

Special fittings are provided so that after the plates and post are
properly set a form can be built on the comb which not only locks the
plates in the comb but prevents the hot lead from running off while
burning and makes the finished strap of exactly the proper dimensions to
properly fit into the jar.

For use in the smaller shop the small Ambu Plate Burning Rack, Figure
16, is recommended. It has all the features of the larger rack but the
spacings of the combs limit it to the ^7⁄_{64}" and ⅛" spacings such as
are found in all the popular batteries.

                           AMBU POST BUILDERS

After the top connectors have been drilled off and the group is to be
reassembled in the repaired battery, in order to make a good quick weld
to the top strap, the post must be built up to its original height.

[Illustration: Figure 17. See bottom of page]

The Ambu Post Builders, Figure 17, have been built to speed up the post
building process. They are made of high grade steel and are of the
proper size to rebuild all the standard battery posts.

Simply place the proper Ambu Post Builder on the stub post, and burn in
molten lead to the proper height. The construction is such that the post
builder is easily removed, leaving a new and perfectly sized post for
burning to the cell connector.

The set of ten, illustrated in Figure 17, covers all standard makes of
batteries.

                  Johnson Direct-jet Lead Melting Pots

[Illustration: No. 300]

[Illustration: No. 8]

In line with our desire to serve the Battery Service Stations of the
country, we have arranged to offer the Johnson Direct-jet Gas-fired
Melting Pots. These furnaces use either natural or manufactured gas.

[Illustration]

Simplest, most efficient and easiest to read battery tester ever yet
offered to the battery owner. Unlike any hydrometer or tester on the
market. Instead of the glass float used on ordinary hydrometers, which
are hard to read and understand, it has three balls, colored red, white
and green which tell the whole story.

Astonishingly simple to test a battery with it, because the following
jingle regarding the three balls, and the positions they assume in the
electrolyte or liquid tells the story—

              “Floats all three, battery is charged fully.
              Sinks the white, charge still right,
              Sinks the green, charge is lean,
              Sinks the red, charge is dead.”

A battery can be tested with it with as much accuracy as any hydrometer
on the market. The specific gravity of each ball is accurate to the
fourth decimal point. It can be “read” in semi-darkness.

Is only 6½ inches long and designed so that it can be carried in the
tool box where it is _Always Handy_—A mighty big value for only 75c.

Furnished to the Dealer in an attractive counter display box, one dozen
to each package. When placed on the counter it sells itself.

You have been reading how to increase the profits of your shop through
the use of materials previously wasted. There is another way of stopping
leaks and increasing earnings. That is by making the best possible use
of every man's time.

In this connection we would like to tell you briefly about the
activities of the Educational Division of the American Bureau of
Engineering, Inc.

This institution foresaw the need of providing instruction on
fundamental electricity, ignition, starting and lighting and storage
batteries, so that garage owners, foremen, general repair men and
mechanics could handle electrical repair jobs at a profit.

[Illustration]

  Here in Chicago we are offering an eight weeks' course of forty-four
  hours per week, devoted to intensive instruction in theory and
  practical shop work. This training enables the student to become an
  expert in this highly specialized field, fitting him to supervise
  the work of other mechanics or to operate a shop of his own as an
  expert in Automotive Electrical Repairs.

  For those unable to leave their employment and come to Chicago, we
  have developed a series of Home Study problems and solutions which
  have proved interesting and practical. Lesson schedules can be
  arranged to suit the individual student. Close personal cooperation
  aids the Home Study student in making satisfactory progress.

  The two methods of instruction are identical with the exception that
  the Resident Student gets actual practice in addition to theory.

  Through our other activities we are able to keep in close touch with
  the situation and be certain that the instruction offered is
  strictly up-to-date and practical.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
