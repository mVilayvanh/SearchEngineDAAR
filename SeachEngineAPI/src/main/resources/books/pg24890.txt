¶ The prophete Ionas/ with an introduccion before teachinge to
vnderstonde him and the right vse also of all the scripture/ and why it
was written/ and what is therin to be sought/ and shewenge wherewith the
scripture is locked vpp that he which readeth it/ can not vnderstonde it/
though he studie therin neuer so moch: and agayne with what keyes it is
so opened/ that the reader can be stopped out with no sotilte or false
doctrine of man/ from the true sense and vnderstondynge therof.




W. T. vn to the Christen reader.

As [the] envious Philistenes stopped [the] welles of Abraham and filled
them vpp with erth/ to put [the] memoriall out of minde/ to [the] entent
[that] they might chalenge [the] grounde: even so the fleshly minded
ypocrites stoppe vpp the vaynes of life which are in [the] scripture/
[with] the erth of theyr tradicions/ false similitudes & lienge
allegories: & [that] of like zele/ to make [the] scripture theyr awne
possession & marchaundice: and so shutt vpp the kingdome of heven which
is Gods worde nether enteringe in them selues nor soferinge them that
wolde.

¶ The scripture hath a body with out/ and within a soule/ sprite & life.
It hath [with] out a barke/ a shell and as it were an hard bone for [the]
fleshly mynded to gnaw vppon. And within it hath pith/ cornell/ mary &
all swetnesse for Gods electe which he hath chosen to geve them his
spirite/ & to write his law & [the] faith of his sonne in their hertes.

¶ The scripture conteyneth .iii. thinges in it first [the] law to condemne
all flesh: secondaryly [the] Gospell/ [that] is to saye/ promises of
mercie for all [that] repent & knowlege their sinnes at the preachinge
of [the] law & consent in their hertes that the law is good/ & submitte
them selues to be scolers to lern to kepe the lawe & to lerne to beleue
[the] mercie that is promised them: & thridly the stories & liues of
those scolars/ both what chaunces fortuned them/ & also by what meanes
their scolemaster taught them and made them perfecte/ & how he tried the
true from the false.

¶ When [the] ypocrites come to [the] lawe/ they put gloses to and make no
moare of it then of a worldly law which is satisfied with [the] outwarde
worke and which a turke maye also fulfill. When yet Gods law never
ceaseth to condemne a man vntill it be written in his herte and vntill he
kepe it naturally without compulsion & all other respecte saue only of
pure love to God and his neyboure/ as he naturally eateth when he is an
hongred/ without compulsion & all other respecte/ saue to slake his hongre
only.

¶ And when they come to the Gospell/ there they mingle their leuen & saye/
God now receaueth vs no moare to mercie/ but of mercie receaueth vs to
penaunce/ that is to wete/ holy dedes [that] make them fatt belies & vs
their captiues/ both in soule and body. And yet they fayne theyr Idole
[the] Pope so mercifull/ [that] if thou make a litle money glister in
his Balams eyes/ there is nether penaunce ner purgatory ner any fastinge
at all but to fle to heven as swefte as a thought and at the
twinkellynge of an eye.

¶ And the liues stories and gestes of men which are contayned in the
bible/ they reade as thinges no moare perteyninge vn to them/ then a take
of Robin hode/ & as thinges they wott not wherto they serue/ saue to fayne
false discant & iuglinge allegories/ to stablish their kingdome with all.
And one [the] chefest & fleshliest studie they have/ is to magnifie
[the] sayntes aboue measure & aboue [the] trueth & with their poetrie to
make them greater then euer God make them. And if they finde any
infirmite or synne asscribed vn to [the] saintes/ that they excuse with
all diligence/ diminushinge the glorie of [the] mercie of God & robbinge
wretched sinners of all theyr comforte/ & thinke therby to flater the
sayntes and to obtayne their fauoure & to make speciall aduocates of
them: even as a man wold obtayne [the] fauoure of wordely tirantes: as
they also fayne the saintes moch moare cruell then ever was any heathen
man & moare wrekefull and vengeable then [the] poetes faine their godes
or their furies [that] torment [the] soules in hell/ if theyr euens be
not fasted & their images visited & saluted wyth a Pater noster (whych
prayer only oure lippes be accoynted with oure hertes vnderstondinge none
at all) and worsheped [with] a candell & [the] offeringe of oure deuocion/
in [the] place which thei haue chosen to heare [the] supplicacions & meke
peticions of their clientes therin.

¶ But thou reader thinke of [the] law of God how [that] it is all to
gether spirituall/ & so spirituall [that] it is neuer fulfilled [with]
dedes or werkes/ vntill they flow out of thyne herte [with] as greate
loue toward thy neyboure/ for no deseruinge of his ye though he be thine
enimie/ as Christ loued [the] and did for the/ for no deseruinge of thyne/
but even when thou wast his enimie. And in [the] meane time/ thoroute all
our infancie & childhod in Christ/ tyll we be growen vpp in to perfecte
men in the full knowlege of christ & full loue of christ agayne & of
oure neyboures for his sake/ after [the] ensample of his loue to vs/
rembenbir that [the] fulfillynge of [the] law is/ a fast fayth in
christes bloud coupled [with] our profession & submyttinge our selues to
lerne to doo better.

¶ And of [the] Gospell or promises which thou metest in [the] scripture/
beleue fast [that] God will fulfill them vn to [the]/ and that vn to
[the] vttemost Iott/ at the repentaunce of thyne herte/ when thou turnest
to hym & forsakest euell/ even of his goodnesse & fatherly mercie vn to
the/ and not for thy flatteringe hym with ypocritish workes of thyne awne
fayninge. So [that] a fast faith only with out respecte of all workes/
is the forgeuenesse both of the synne which we did in tyme of ignoraunce
with luste and consent to synne/ & also of all the synne which we doo by
chaunce & of frailte/ after [that] we are come to knowlege and have
professed [the] law out of oure hertes. And all dedes serue only for to
helpe oure neyboures & to tame oure flesh that we fall not to synne
agayne/ & to exercice oure soules in vertue/ & not to make satisfaction
to Godward for [the] synne [that] is once paste.

¶ And all other stories of [the] bible/ with out excepcion/ are [the]
practisinge of [the] law & of the Gospell/ and are true and faitfull
ensamples & sure erneste [that] God will euen so deale with vs/ as he
did with them/ in all infirmities/ in all temptacions/ & in all like cases
& chaunces. Wherin ye se on [the] one syde/ how fatherly & tendirly &
with all compassion god entreateth his electe which submitte them selues
as scolers/ to lerne to walke in the wayes of his lawes/ & to kepe them
of loue. If they forgatt them selues at a time & went astraye/ he sought
them out & sett them agayne with all mercie. If they fell & hurte them
selues/ he healed them agayne with all compassion & tendernesse of hert.
He hath ofte brought greate tribulation & aduersite vppon his electe:
but all of fatherly loue only/ to teach them & to make them se their awne
hertes & [the] sinne [that] there laye hid/ that they might aftirwarde
feale his mercie. For his mercie wayted vppon them/ to rid them out
agayne/ assone as they ware lerned & come to [the] knowlege of their
awne hertes: so that he neuer cast man awaye how depe so euer he had
sinned/ saue them only which had first cast [the] yocke of his lawes from
their neckes/ with vtter diffiaunce & malice of herte.

Which ensamples how comfortable are they for vs/ when we be fallen in to
sinne & God is come vppon vs with a scorge/ [that] we dispeare not/ but
repent with full hope of mercie after [the] ensamples of mercie [that]
are gone before: And therfore they were written for our lerninge/ as
testifieth Paul Ro. xv. to comforte vs/ [that] we might [the] better put
oure hope & trust in God/ when we se/ how mercifull he hath bene in tymes
past vn to our weake brethern [that] are gone before/ in all theyr
aduersities/ neade/ temptacions/ ye & horrible synnes in to which they
now & then fell.

¶ And on [the] other side ye se how they [that] hardened their hertes &
synned of malice & refused mercie [that] was offered them & had no power
to repent/ perished at [the] later ende with all confusion & shame
mercilessely. Which ensamples are very good & necessary/ to kepe vs in
awe & dreade in tyme of prosperite as thou maist se by Paul. j. Cor. x.
that we abyde in the feare of God/ & wax not wild and fall to vanities
and so synne and prouoke God and bringe wrath vppon vs.

¶ And thridly ye se in that practise/ how as god is mercifull &
longesoferynge/ euen so were all his true prophetes & prechers/ beringe
the infirmities of their weake brethern & their awne wronges & iniuries
with all pacience & longesoferinge/ neuer castinge any of them of their
backes/ vn tyll they synned agenst [the] holygost/ maliciously
persecutinge [the] open & manifest trouth: contrary vn to the ensample of
[the] Pope/ which in sinninge agenst God & to quench [the] trueth of his
holy spirite/ is euer chefe captayne and trompetblower/ to sett other
awerke/ and seketh only his awne fredome/ liberte/ priuilege/ welth/
prosperite/ profite/ pleasure/ pastyme/ honoure & glorie/ with [the]
bondage/ thraldome/ captiuite/ miserie/ wretchednesse & vile subiection
of his brethern: & in his awne cause is so feruent/ so steffe & cruell/
that he will not sofre one word spoken agenst his false magiste/ wily
inuencions and iuglynge ypocrisie to be vnaduenged/ thongh all
christendome shuld be sett to gether by the eares/ and shuld cost he
cared not how many hundred thousande their lives.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now [that] thou mayst reade Ionas frutefully & not as a poetis fable/
but as an obligacon betwene God and thy soule/ as an ernist peny geuen
[the] of God/ [that] he wil helpe [the] in time of nede/ if thou turne
to him and as the word of god [the] only fode and life of thy soule/ this
marke & note. First count Ionas the frend of god and a man chosen of god
to testifie his name vn to [the] worlde: but yet a younge scolar/ weake
& rude/ after [the] facion of [the] appostles/ while Christ was yet with
them bodyly. Which though Christ taught them euer to be meke & to vmble
them selues/ yet oft stroue amonge them selues who shuld be greatest. The
sonnes of Zebede wold sitt/ the one on the right honde of Christ and the
other on [the] lifte. They wold praye/ that fire might descende from
heuen/ and consume the Samaritanes.

¶ When Christ axed who saye men that I am/ Peter answered/ thou arte the
sonne of the lyuinge God/ as though Peter had bene as perfecte as an
angell. But immediatly after/ when Christ preached vn to them of his
deeth & passion/ Peter was angre & rebuked Christe & thought ernestly
[that] he had raued & not wist what he sayde: as at a nother time/ when
Christ was so feruently busied in healinge [the] people/ [that] he had
not leyser to eate/ they went out to holde him/ supposinge that he had
bene besyde him selfe. Ande one [that] cast out deuels in Christes name/
they forbade/ because he wayted not on them/ so glorious were they yet.

¶ And though christ taughte all waye to forgeue/ yet peter after longe
goenge to scole/ axed wether men shuld forgeue .vij. tymes/ thynkinge
[that] .viij. tymes had bene to moch. And at [the] last soper Peter wold
have died with christe/ but yet within fewe howres after/ he denied hym/
both cowardly & shamefully. And after [the] same maner/ though he had so
longe herd that noman might auenge him selfe/ but rather turne [the] other
cheke to/ then to smyte agayne/ yet when Christ was in takinge/ peter
axed whether it were lawfull to smyte with [the] swerde/ and taried none
answere/ but layed on rashly. So that though when we come first vn to
[the] knowlege of the trueth/ and the peace is made betwene God & vs/ &
we loue his lawes & beleue & trust in hym/ as in oure father & haue good
hertes vn to him & be born anew in [the] sprite: yet we are but childern
and younge scolars weake & foble & must have leysar to grow in [the]
spirite/ in knowlege/ loue & in [the] dedes therof/ as younge childern
must have tyme to grow in their bodies.

¶ And God oure father & scolemaster fedeth vs & teached vs accordinge vn
to the capacite of oure stomakes/ & maketh vs to grow & waxe perfecte/ &
fineth vs & trieth vs as gold/ in [the] fire of temptacions &
tribulations. As Moses wittneseth Deutero. viij. sayenge: Remember all
[the] waye by which [the] lord thy God caried [the] this .xl. yeres in
[the] wildernesse/ to vmble the & to tempte or proue the/ [that] it might
be knowen what were in thine hert. He brougt the in to aduersite & made
[the] an hongred/ & then feed [the] with man which nether thou ner yet
thi fathers euer knew of/ to teach [the] that a man liueth not by bred
only/ but by all that proceadeth out of the mouth of God. For [the]
promises of god are life vn to all [that] cleaue vn to them/ moch moare
then is bred & bodyly sustinaunce: as [the] iourney of [the] childern of
Israel out of egypte in to [the] londe promised them/ ministreth the
notable ensamples & [that] aboundantly/ as doeth all [the] rest of the
bible also. How be it/ it is impossible for flesh to beleue & to trust
in [the] trueth of gods promises/ vntyll he haue lerned it in moch
tribulacion/ after that God hath deliuered him out therof agayne.

¶ God therfore to teach Ionas & to shew him his awne hert & to make him
perfecte & to enstructe vs also bi his ensample/ sent him out of [the]
lande of Israel where he was a prophete/ to goo amonge [the] heathen
people & to [the] greatest & mightiest citie of [the] world then/ called
Niniue: to preache [that] within .xl. dayes they shuld all perish for
their sinnes & that [the] citie shuld be ouerthrowen. Which message [the]
frewil of Ionas had as moch power to doo/ as the weakest herted woman in
the world hath power/ if she were commaunded/ to leppe in to a tobbe of
lyuinge snakes & edders: as happely if God had commaunded Sara to haue
sacrificed hir sonne Isaac/ as he did Abraham/ she wold haue disputed
with him yer she had done it/ or though she were stronge ynough/ yet many
an holy seint coud not haue found in their hertes/ but wold haue
disobeyed and haue runne awaye from [the] presens of [the] commaundement of
god [with] Ionas if thei had bene so strongly tempted.

¶ For Ionas thought of this maner: loo/ I am here a prophete vn to Gods
people the Israelites. Which though they haue gods word testified vn to
them dayly/ yet dispice it & worshepe God vnder [the] likenesse of
calues & after all maner facions saue after his awne worde/ & therfore
are of all nacions [the] worst & most worthy of punishment. And yet god
for loue of few [that] are amonge them & for his names sake spareth them
& defendeth them. How then shuld god take so cruell vengeaunce on so
greate a multitude of them to whome his name was neuer preached to and
therfore are not [the] tenth parte so euel as these? If I shal therfore
goo preach so shall I lye & shame my selfe & God therto and make them
the moare to dispice god and sett the lesse by him and to be the moare
cruell vn to his people.

¶ And vppon that imaginacion he fled from the face or presens of God: that
is/ out of [the] contre where God was worsheped in & from prosecutynge of
Gods commaundement/ and thought/ I wyll gett me a nother waye amonge [the]
hethen people & be no moare a prophete/ but lyue at rest & out of all
combraunce. Neuer [the] lesse the god of all mercie which careth for his
electe childern & turneth all vn to good to them & smiteth them to heale
them agayne & killeth them to make them aliue agayne/ & playeth with them
(as a father doth some tyme with his younge ignoraunt childern) &
tempteth them & proueth them to make them se theyr awne hertes/ prouided
for Ionas/ how all thinge shuld be.

¶ When Ionas was entered in to the sheppe/ he layed him downe to slepe
and to take his rest: that is/ his conscience was tossed betwene the
commaudement of God which sent him to Niniue/ & his fleshly wisdome that
dissuaded & counseled hym [the] contrary & at [the] last preualed agenst
[the] commaundement & caried hym a nother waye/ as a sheppe caught betwene
.ii. streames/ & as poetes faine the mother of Meliager to be betwene
diuers affections/ while to aduenge hir brothers deeth/ she sought to sle
hir awne sonne. Where vppon for very payne & tediousnesse/ he laye downe
to slepe/ for to put [the] commaundement which so gnew & freate his
conscience/ out of minde/ as [the] nature of all weked is/ when they haue
sinned a good/ to seke al meanes with riot/ reuell & pastyme/ to driue
[the] remenbraunce of synne out of their thoughtes or as Adam did/ to
couer their nakednesse with aporns of pope holy workes. But God awoke
hym out of his dreame/ and sett his synnes before his face.

¶ For when [the] Lott had caught Ionas/ then be sure [that] his synnes
came to remembraunce agayne & that his conscience raged no lesse then
[the] waues of the se. And then he thought that he only was a sinner &
[the] hethen that ware in [the] shepp none in respecte of him/ ad
thought also/ as veryly as he was fled from god/ that as verily god had
cast him awaye: for [the] sight of [the] rod maketh [the] natural child
not only to se & to knowlege his faulte/ but also to forgett all his
fathers olde mercie & kindnesse. And then he confessed his synne openly &
had yet leuer perish alone then [that] [the] other shuld haue perished
with him for his sake: and so of very desperacion to haue liued any
lenger/ bad cast him in to [the] see betymes/ excepte they wold be lost
also.

¶ To speake of lottes/ how ferforth they are lawfull/ is a light
question. First to vse them for the breakinge of strife/ as when
partenars/ their goodes as equally diuided as they can/ take euery man his
parte by lott/ to auoyde all suspicion of disceytfulnesse: & as [the]
appostles in [the] first of [the] Actes/ when they sought a nother to
succede Iudas the traytoure/ & .ii. persones were presentes/ then to
breake strife & to satisfie al parties/ did cast lotttes/ wheter shuld
be admitted/ desirynge god to teper them & to take whom he knew most mete/
seynge they wist not wheter to preferre/ or haply coude not all agre on
ether/ is lawfull ad in all like cases. But to abuse them vn to [the]
temptinge of God & to compell him therwith to vtter thinges wherof we
stond in doute/ when we haue no commaundement of him so to do/ as these
hethen here dyd/ though God turned it vn to his glorie/ can not be but
euell.

¶ The hethen scepmen asstonied at [the] sight of [the] miracle/ feared
God/ prayed to him/ offered sacrifice & vowed vowes. And I doute not/
but that some of them or haply all came therby vn to the true knowlege &
true worshepinge of God & ware wonne to God in theyr soules. And [thus]
God which is infinite mercifull in all his wayes/ wrought their soules
health out of [the] infirmite of Ionas/ euen of his good will & purpose
& loue wherewith he loued them before the world was made/ & not of
chaunce/ as it appereth vn to the eyes of the ignoraunt.

¶ And that Ionas was .iii. dayes & .iii. nightes in the bely of his
fish: we can not therby proue vn to te Iewes & infideles or vn to any man/
[that] Christ must therfore dye and be buried & rise agayne. But we vse
[the] ensample and likenesse to strength the faith of the weake. For he
that beleaueth the one can not doute in [the] other: in as moch as the
hand of God was no lesse mightie in preseruinge Ionas aliue agenst all
naturall possibilite & in deliuerynge him safe out of his fish/ then in
reysynge vpp Christe agayne out of his sepulchre. And we maye describe
[the] power & vertue of [the] resurreccion therby/ as Christ him selfe
boroweth [the] similitude therto Mat. xij. sayenge vn to [the] Iewes that
came aboute him & desyred a signe or a wonder from heuen to certifye them
that he was christ: this euell & wedlockebreakinge nacion (which breake
[the] wedlocke of faith wherwith they be maried vn to God/ and beleue in
their false workes) seke a signe/ but there shal no signe be geuen them
saue [the] signe of the Prophete Ionas. For as Ionas was .iij. dayes and
iij. nightes in the bely of the whale/ euen so shall the sonne of man be
.iij. dayes & .iij. nyghtes in the herte of the erth. Which was a watch
word/ as we saye/ & a sharpe threateninge vn to [the] Iewes & as moch to
saye as thus/ ye harde herted Iewes seke a signe: loo/ thys shalbe youre
sygne/ as Ionas was reysed out of the sepulchre of his fishe & then
sent vn to the Niniuites to preach [that] they shuld perish/ euen so
shall I ryse agayne out of my sepulchre & come & preach repentaunce vn
to you. Se therfore when ye se [the] signe that ye repent or else ye shal
suerly perish & not escape. For though the infirmities which ye now se in
my flesh be a lett vn to youre faythes/ ye shall yet then be with out
excuse/ when ye se so greate a miracle & so greate power of god shed out
vppon you. And so Christe came agayne after [the] resurreccion/ in his
spirite & preached repentaunce vn to them/ by the mouth of his appostles
& disciples/ & with miracles of [the] holy gost. And all that repented
not perished shortly after and were for [the] most parte slayne with
swerde and [the] rest caried awaye captiue in to all quarters of the
world for an ensample/ as ye se vn to this daye.

¶ And in lyke maner sens the world beganne/ where soeuer repentaunce was
offered and not receaued/ there God toke cruell vengeaunce immediatly:
as ye se in [the] floud of Noe/ in the ouerthrowenge of Sodom & Gomor &
all the contre aboute: & as ye se of Egipte/ of the Amorites/ Cananites
& afterwarde of the very Israelites/ & then at the last of the Iewes to/
and of the Assyriens and Babyloniens and so thorout all the imperes of
the world.

¶ Gyldas preached repentaunce vn to [the] olde Britaynes that inhabited
englond: they repented not/ & therfore God sent in theyr enimies vppon them
on euery side & destroyed them vpp & gaue the lond vn to other nacions. And
greate vengeaunce hath bene taken in that lande for synne sens that tyme.

¶ Wicleffe preached repentaunce vn to oure fathers not longe sens: they
repented not for their hertes were indurat & theyr eyes blinded with
their awne Pope holy rightwesnesse wherwith they had made theyr soules
gaye agenst the receauinge agayne of [the] weked spirite that bringeth
.vii. worse then hym selfe with him & maketh [the] later ende worse then
the beginninge: for in open sinnes there is hope of repentaunce/ but in
holy ypocrisie none at all. But what folowed? they slew their true &
right kinge and sett vpp .iii. wronge kinges arow/ vnder which all the
noble bloud was slayne vpp and halfe the comens therto/ what in fraunce &
what with their awne swerde/ in fightinge amonge them selues for [the]
crowne/ & [the] cities and townes decayed and the land brought halfe in
to a wyldernesse in respecte of that it was before.

¶ And now Christ to preach repentaunce/ is resen yet once agayne out of
his sepulchre in which the pope had buried him and kepte him downe with
his pilars and polaxes and all disgysinges of ypocrisie/ with gyle/
wiles and falshed/ and with the swerd of al princes which he had blynded
with his false marchaundice. And as I dowte not of [the] ensamples that
are past/ so am I sure that greate wrath will folow/ excepte repentaunce
turne it backe agayne and cease it.

¶ When Ionas had bene in te fishes bely a space & the rage of his
conscience was somewhat quieted and swaged and he come to him selfe
agayne and had receaued a lytle hope/ the qualmes & panges of desperacion
which went ouer hys hert/ halfe ouercome/ he prayed/ as he maketh
mencion in the texte sayenge: Ionas prayed vn to the lord his god out of
the bely of the fishe. But the wordes of that prayer are not here sett.
The prayer [that] here stondeth in the texte/ is the prayer of prayse &
thankesgeuenge which he prayed and wrote when he was escaped and past all
ieopardie.

¶ In the end of which prayer he sayth/ I will sacrifice with the voyce
of thankesgeuenge and paye that I haue vowed/ that sauinge cometh of the
lorde. For verely to confesse out of the herte/ that all benefites come
of God/ euen out of the goodnesse of his mercie and not deseruinge of
oure dedes/ is the only sacrifice that pleaseth God. And to beleue that
god only is the sauer/ is the thynge that all the Iewes vowed in theyr
circumcision/ as we in oure baptim. Which vowe Ionas now tawght with
experience/ promiseth to paye. For those outwarde sacrifices of bestes/
vn to which Ionas had haply asscribed to moch before/ were but feble &
childish thinges & not ordeyned/ that the workes of them selues shuld be
a seruice vn to god/ but vn to the people/ to put them in remembraunce
of this inwarde sacrifice of thankes & of faith to trust and beleue in
God the only sauer. Which significacion when was awaye/ they were
abhominable and deuellysh ydolatrye and imageseruice: as oure ceremonies
and sacramentes are become now to all that trust & beleue in the werke
of them and ar not taught the significacions/ to edifye theyr soules
with knowlege and the doctrine of God.

¶ When Ionas was cast vppon lond agayne/ then his will was fre and had
power to goo whother God sent him & to doo what God bade/ his awne
imaginacions layed a parte. For he had bene at a new scole/ ye and in a
fornace where he was purged of moch refuse & droshe of fleshly wisdome/
which resisted [the] wisdome of god & led Ionases wil contrary vn to
[the] will of god. For as ferre as we be blynd in Adam/ we can not but
seke & will oure awne profitt/ pleasure & glorie. And as ferre as we be
taughte in the sprite/ we can not but seke & wyll the pleasure and
glorie of God only.

¶ And as for the .iij. dayes iourney of Niniue/ whether it were in
length or to goo rounde aboute it or thorow all the stretes/ I committe
vn to the discrecion of other men. But I thinke that it was then the
greatest citie of the world.

¶ And that Ionas went a dayes iourney in the citie/ I suppose he did it
not in one daye: but went fayre & easyly preachinge here a sermon & there
a nother & rebuked the synne of the people for which they must perishe.

¶ And when thou art come vn to the repentaunce of the Niniuites/ there
hast thou sure ernest/ that how soeuer angre god be/ yet he remembreth
mercie vn to all that truly repent and beleue in mercie. Which ensample
oure sauioure Christ also casteth in the teeth of the indurat Iewes
sayenge: the Niniuites shall rise in iudgement with this nation and
condemne them/ for they repented at the preachynge of Ionas/ and beholde
a greater then Ionas here/ meanynge of hym selfe. At whose preachinge
yet/ though it were neuer so mightie to perce the herte/ & for all his
miracles therto/ the hard herted Iewes coude not repent: when the
heathen Niniuites repented at the bare preachynge of Ionas rebukinge
theyr synnes with out any miracle at all.

¶ Why? for [the] Iewes had leuended the spirituall law of God and with
theyr gloses had made it all to gether erthie and fleshly/ and so had
sett a vayle or coueringe on Moses face/ to shodowe and darken [the]
glorious brightnesse of his contenaunce. It was synne to stele: but to
robbe wedowes howses vnder a coloure of longe prayenge/ & to polle in the
name of offeringes/ and to snare [the] people with intollerable
constitucions agenst all loue/ to ketch theyr money out of theyr purses/
was no synne at all.

¶ To smyte father and mother was synn: But to withdraw helpe from them at
theyr nede/ for blynde zele of offeringe/ vn to the profytt of the holy
phareses/ was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kynne
chose wheter they will synke or sweme/ while thou byldest and makest
goodly fundations for holy people which thou hast chosen to be thy
christe/ for to sowple thy soule with the oyle of theyr swete
blessynges/ & to be thy Iesus for to saue thy soule from [the] purgatory
of the bloud that only purgeth synne/ with theyr watchinge/ fastinge/
wolward goinge & rysynge at mydnyght etc. where wyth yet they purge not
them selues from theyr couetousnesse/ pryde/ lechury or any vyce that
thou seyst amonge the laye people.

¶ It was greate synne for Christ to heale the people on the sabboth daye
vn to the glorie of God hys father/ but none at all for them to helpe
theyr catell vnto theyr awne profett.

¶ It was synne to eate wyth vnwashen handes or on an vnwashen table/ or
out of an vnwashen dish: but to eate out of that purifyed dysh that
which came of brybery/ theft & extorsion/ was no synne at all.

¶ It was exceadynge meritorious to make many dyscyples: But to teach
them to feare God in hys ordynaunces/ had they no care at all.

¶ The hye prelates so defended the ryght of holy church and so feared the
people with the curse of God & terreble paynes of hell/ that no man
durst leaue the vilest herke in hys gardeyne vntythed. And the offerynge
and thynges dedycat vn to God for the profitt of hys holy vycars where
in soch estymacion and reuerence/ that it was moch greater synne to
sweare truly by them/ then to forswere thy selfe by God: what vengeaunce
then of God/ and how terreble and cruell damnacion thynke ye preached
they to fall on them that had stolen soch holy thinges? And yet sayth
Christ/ that ryghtwesnesse and faith in kepynge promise/ mercie and
indyfferent iudgement were vtturly troden vnder fote and cleane dispysed
of those blessed fathers/ whych so mightely mayntened Arons patrimony and
had mad it so prosperous and enuironed it and walled it aboute on euery
syde with [the] feare of god/ that noman durst twech it.

¶ It was greate holynesse to garnysh [the] sepulchres of [the] prophetes
& to condemne their awne fathers for sleynge of them: and yet were they
them selues for blinde zele of their awne constitucions/ as ready as their
fathers to sle whosoeuer testified vn to them/ the same trueth which
the prophetes testified vn to theyr fathers. So that Christ compareth all
the rightwesnesse of those holy patriarkes vn to the outwarde bewtye of
a paynted sepulchre full of stench and all vn clennesse wythyn.

¶ And finally to begyld a mans neyboure in sotle bargeninge and to
wrappe and compase him in with cauteles of the law/ was then as it is now
in the kingdome of [the] Pope. By the reason where of they excluded the
law of loue out of theyr hertes/ and consequently all true repentaunce: for
how coude they repent of [that] they coude not se to be sinne?

¶ And on the other syde they had sett vpp a rightwesnesse of holy
workes/ to clense theyr soules with all: as the Pope sanctifieth vs with
holy oyle/ holy bred/ holy salt/ holy candels/ holy dome ceremonies and
holy dome blessynges/ and with what soever holynesse thou wilt saue with
the holynes of Gods worde which only speaketh vn to the herte and
sheweth the soule hir filthynesse and vnclennesse of synne/ and leadeth
hir by [the] waye of repentaunce vn to [the] fountayne of Christes
bloude to washe it awaye thorow faith. By the reason of which false
rightwesnesse they were dysobedient vn to the rightwesnesse of God/
which is the forgeuenesse of synne in Christes bloude and coude not
beleue it. And so thorow fleshly interpretynge the law and false imagined
rightwesnesse/ their hertes were hardened and made as stony as clay in an
hote furnace of fire/ that they coude receaue nether repentaunce ner
faith or any moyster of grace at all.

¶ But the hethen Niniuites/ though they were blynded with lustes a good/
yet were in thofe .ii. poyntes vncorrupte and vnhardened/ & therfore
with the only preachinge of Ionas came vn to the knowlege of their
synnes and confessed them & repented truly & turned euery man from his
euell dedes & declared theyr sorow of hert & true repentaunce/ with
theyr dedes which they dyd out of faith & hope of forgeuenesse/
chastysinge their bodies with prayer & fastinge & with takinge all
pleasures from the flesh: trustynge/ as god was angre for their
wekedness/ even so shuld he forgeue them of hys mercye/ yf they repented
& forsoke their mysse lyuinge.

¶ And in the last ende of all/ thou hast yet a goodly ensample of
lernynge/ to se how erthye Ionas is styll for all hys tryenge in the
whales bely. He was so sore displeased because the Niniuites perished
not/ that he was wery of hys lyfe and wished after the deeth for very
sorow & payne/ that he had loost the glorie of his prophesienge/ in that
his prophesie come not to passe. But god rebuked him with a likenesse
sayenge: it greueth thyne hert for the losse of a vile shrobbe or
spraye/ wheron thou bestoweddest no loboure or cost/ nether was it thyne
handwerke. How moch moare then shuld greue myne herte/ the losse of so
greate a multitude of innocentes as are in Niniue/ which are all myne
handes werke. Nay Ionas/ I am God ouer all/ and father as well vn to the
hethen as vn to the Iewes and mercifull to all and warne yer I smyte:
nether threte I so cruelly by any prophete/ but that I wyll forgeue yf
they repent and ax mercie: nether on the other syde/ what soeuer I
promyse/ wyll I fulfyll it/ saue for theyr sakes only whych trust in me
and submitte them selues to kepe my lawes of very loue/ as naturall
chyldern.

       *       *       *       *       *

On thys maner to read [the] scripture is [the] right vse therof & why
[the] holy gost caused it to be written. That is [that] thou first seke
out [the] law/ what god will haue the to doo/ interpretinge it
spiritually with out glose or coueringe the brightnesse of Moses face/
so [that] thou fele in thyne hert/ how that it is damnable synne before
god/ not to loue they neyboure that is thyne enimie/ as puerly as Christ
loued the/ and [that] not to loue thy neyboure in thyne herte/ is to
haue committed all ready all synne agenst him. And therfore vn tyll that
loue become/ thou must knowlege vnfaynedly that there is synne in the
best dede thou doest. And it must ernestly greue thyne hert and thou
must washe all thy good dedes in christes bloude/ yer they can be pure
and an acceptable sacrifice vn to God/ and must desire god [the] father
for his sake/ to take thi dedes aworth & to pardon [the] imperfectenesse
of them/ & to geue the power to doo them better and with moare feruent
loue.

¶ And on the other syde thou must serch diligently for the promises of
mercie which God hath promised the agayne. Which .ii. poyntes/ that is
to wete/ [the] lawe spiritually interpreted/ how that all is damnable
synne that is not vnfayned loue out of the grownde and botom of the
herte after the ensample of Christes loue to vs/ because we be all
equally created and formed of one god oure father/ and indifferently
bought & redemed with one bloud of oure sauioure Iesus Christe: and that
the promises be geuen vn to a repentynge soule that thursteth and
longeth after them/ of the pure and fatherly mercie of god thorow oure
faith onely with oute al deseruinge of oure dedes or merites of oure
werkes/ but for Christes sake alone and for the merites and deseruinges
of his werkes/ deth and passions that he sofered all to gether for vs &
not for him selfe: whych .ii. poyntes I saye/ if they be written in
thine herte/ are the keyes which so open all the scripture vn to the/
that no creature can locke the out/ and with which thou shalt goo in and
out/ and finde pasture and fode euery where. And yf these lesons be not
writtten in thyne herte/ then is all the scripture shutt vpp/ as a
cornell in the shale/ so that thou mayst read it and comen of it and
reherse all the stories of it and dispute sotilly and be a profounde
sophister/ and yet vnderstond not one Iot therof.

¶ And thridly that thou take the stories & liues which are conteyned in
the bible/ for sure and vndowted ensamples/ [that] God so will deale with
vs vn to the worldes ende.

¶ Here with Reader farewell and be commended vn to God/ and vn to the
grace of hys spryte. And first se that thou stoppe not thyne eares vn to
the callynge of god/ and that thou harden not thine herte begyled with
fleshly interpretinge of the law & false imagined and ypocritish
rightwesnesse/ and so the Niniuites ryse with the at [the] day of
iudgement & condemne the.

¶ And secondarily if thou finde ought amisse/ when thou seyst thy selfe
in the glasse of Gods worde/ thynke it compendious wisdome/ to amende
[the] same betymes/ moneshed & warned by the ensample of other men/
rather then to tary vntill thou be beten also.

¶ And thridly if it shall so chaunce/ that [the] wild lustes of thy
flesh shall blynd the and carie the cleane awaye with them for a tyme:
yet at the later ende/ when [the] god of all mercie shall haue compased
the in on euery syde with temptacions/ tribulacions/ aduersities &
combraunce/ to bringe [the] home agayne vn to thyne awne herte/ & to set
thy sinnes wich thou woldest so fayne couer & put out of mynd with
delectacion of voluptuous pastymes/ before [the] eyes of thy conscience:
then call [the] faithfull ensample of Ionas & all lyke stories vn to thy
remembraunce/ and with Ionas turne vn to thi father that smote [the]: not
to cast [the] awaye/ but to laye a corosie and a freatinge playster vn to
[the] pocke that laye hid & fret inwarde/ to draw [the] disease out & to
make it appere/ [that] thou mightest feale thy seckenes & [the] daunger
therof & come & receaue the healynge playster of mercie.

¶ And forget not [that] what soeuer ensample of mercie god hath shewed
sens [the] beginninge of [the] world/ the same is promised the/ yf thou
wilt in like maner turne agayne and receaued it as they dyd. And with
Ionas be aknowen of thy synne & confesse it & knowlege it vn to thy
father.

¶ And as [the] law which freteth thy conscience/ is in thyne herte & is
none outwarde thinge/ even so seke within in thine herte/ [the] playster
of mercie/ the promyses of forgeuenesse in oure sauioure Iesus Christe/
accordinge vn to all the ensamples of mercie that are gonne before.

¶ And with Ionas let them that wayte on vanities & seke god here & there
& in euery temple saue in their hertes goo/ & seke thou [the] testament of
god in thyne hert. For in thyne hert is the worde of [the] law/ & in
thyne hert is [the] worde of fayth in the promises of mercie in Iesus
Christe. So that yf thou confesse with a repentynge herte & knowlege and
surely beleue [that] Iesus is lorde ouer all synne/ thou art saffe.

¶ And finally when the rage of thy conscience is ceased and quieted with
fast faith in the promises of mercie/ then offer with Ionas the
offeringe of prayse and thankesgeuinge/ & paye the vowe of thy baptim/
that God only saueth/ of his only mercie & goodnesse: that is/ beleue
stedfastly & preach constantly/ that it is God only that smyteth/ and God
only that healeth: ascribynge [the] cause of thy tribulation vn to thyne
awne synne/ and [the] cause of thy deliueraunce vn to the mercie of God.

¶ And be ware of the leuen [that] saith we haue power in oure fre will
before [the] preachinge of [the] Gospell/ to deserue grace/ to kepe
[the] law/ of congruite/ or god to be vnrightwesse. And saie with Ihon in
the first/ [that] as [the] law was geuen by Moses/ euen so grace to
fulfill it/ is geuen by christe. And when they saye oure dedes with grace
deserue heuen/ saye thou [with] Paule Ro. vj. [that] euerlastinge life is
the gifte of god thorow Iesus Christ oure lorde/ & [that] we be made
sonnes by faith Ihon. j. & therfore heyres of god with christ Ro. viij.
And saye that we receaue al of god thorow faith that foloweth
repentaunce/ & [that] we doo not oure werkes vn to god/ but ether vn to
oure selues/ to sley [the] sinne that remayneth in [the] flesh & to waxe
perfecte/ ether vn to oure neyboures which doo as moch for vs agayne in
some other thinges. And when a man exceadeth in giftes of grace/ let him
vnderstonde that they be geuen him/ as wel for his weake brethern/ as for
him selfe: as though all the bred be committed vn to the panter/ yet for
his felowes with hym/ which geue the thankes vn to theyr lorde/ and
recompence the panter agayne with other kynde seruice in theyr offices.
And when they saye that Christ hath made no satisfaccion for the synne
we doo after oure baptym: saye thou wyth the doctrine of Paule/ that in
oure baptym we receaue the merytes of Christes deeth thorow repentaunce
and fayth of which two/ baptim is the sygne. And though when we synne of
frailtie after oure baptym we receaue the sygne no moare/ yet we be
renewed agayne thorow repentaunce and faith in Christes bloude/ whych
twayne/ the sygne of baptym ever contynved amonge vs in baptisynge oure
younge childern doeth euer kepe in mynde and call vs backe agayne vn to
oure profession if we be gonne astraye/ & promiseth vs forgeuenesse.
Nether can actuall synne be washed awaye with oure werkes/ but with
Christes bloude: nether can there be any other sacrifice or satisfaccion
to Godward for them/ saue Christes bloude. For as moch as we can doo no
werkes vnto God/ but receaue only of his mercie with oure repentynge
fayth/ thorow Iesus Christe oure lorde and only sauer: vnto whom & vn to
God oure father thorow him/ and vn to hys holy spirite/ that only
purgeth/ sanctifieth & washeth vs in the innocent bloude of oure
redemption/ be prayse for ever AMEN.




¶ The Storie of the prophete Ionas.


The first Chapter.

The worde of the lorde came vn to the prophete Ionas [the] sonne of
Amithai sayenge: ryse & gett the to Niniue that greate citie & preach vn
to them/ how that theyr wekednesse is come vpp before me.

¶ And Ionas made him ready to fle to Tharsis from the presens of [the]
lorde/ & gatt hym downe to Ioppe/ and founde there a sheppe ready to goo
to Tharsis/ & payed his fare/ & went aborde/ to goo with them to Tharsis
from the presens of the lorde.

¶ But [the] lorde hurled a greate winde in to [the] se/ so that there
was a myghtie tempest in the se: in so moch [that] the shepp was lyke to
goo in peces. And the mariners were afrayed & cried euery man vn to his
god/ & cast out [the] goodes [that] were in [the] sheppe in to [the] se/
to lighten it of them. But Ionas gatt him vnder the hatches & layed him
downe and slombrede. And [the] master of the sheppe came to him & sayd
vn to him/ why slomberest thou? vpp! & call vn to thy god/ that God maye
thinke on vs/ that we perish not.

¶ And they sayde one to a nother/ come & lett vs cast lottes/ to know
for whose cause we are thus troublede. And they cast lottes. And [the]
lott fell vppon Ionas.

¶ Then they said vnto him/ tel vs for whose cause we are thus trowbled:
what is thine occupacion/ whence comest thou/ how is thy contre called/ &
of what nacion art thou?

¶ And he answered them/ I am an Ebrue: & the lord God of heuen which made
both se and drie land/ I feare. Then were the men exceadingly afrayd &
sayd vn to him/ why diddest thou so? For they knew that he was fled from
the presens of the lorde/ because he had told them.

¶ Then they sayd vn to hym/ what shall we doo vnto the/ that the se maye
cease from trowblinge vs? For the se wrought & was trowblous. And he
answered them/ take me and cast me in to the se/ & so shall it lett you
be in reste: for I wotte/ is is for my sake/ that this greate tempest is
come oppon you. Neuerthelesse the men assayed wyth rowenge to bringe the
sheppe to lande: but it wold not be/ because the se so wrought & was so
trowblous agenst them. Wherefore they cried vn to the lorde & sayd: O
lorde latt vs not perih for this mans deeth/ nether laye innocent bloud
vn to oure charge: for thou lorde even as thy pleasure was/ so thou hast
done.

¶ And then they toke Ionas/ & cast him in to [the] se/ & the se left
ragynge. And [the] men feared the lorde excedingly: & sacrificed
sacrififice vn to the lorde: and vowed vowes.


¶ The seconde Chapter.

But [the] lorde prepared a greate fyshe/ to swalow vp Ionas. And so was
Ionas in [the] bowels of [the] fish .iij. dayes & .iij. nightes. And
Ionas prayed vnto [the] lord his god out of [the] bowels of the fish.

¶ And he sayde: in my tribulacion I called vn to the lorde/ and he
answered me: out of the bely of hell I cried/ and thou herdest my voyce.
For thou hadest cast me downe depe in the middes of the se: & the floud
compased me aboute: and all thy waues & rowles of water went ouer me: & I
thought [that] I had bene cast awaye out of thy sight. But I will yet
agayne loke towarde thy holy temple. The water compased me euen vn to the
very soule of me: the depe laye aboute me: and the wedes were wrappte
aboude myne heed. And I went downe vn to the botome of the hylles/ and
was barredin with erth on euery syde for euer. And yet thou lorde my God
broughest vp my life agayne out of corrupcion. When my soule faynted in
me/ I thought on the lorde: & my prayer came in vn to the/ even in to
thy holy temple. They [that] obserue vayne vanities/ haue forsaken him
that was mercifull vn to them. But I wil sacrifice vn to the with the
voce of thankesgeuinge/ & will paye that I have vowed/ that sauinge
cometh of the lorde.

¶ And the lorde spake vn to the fish: and it cast out Ionas agayne vppon
[the] drie lande.


¶ The .iij. Chapter.

Then came the worde of the lorde vn to Ionas agayne sayenge: vpp/ and
gett [the] to Niniue that greate citie/ & preache vn to them the
preachynge which I bade [the]. And he arose & went to Niniue at [the]
lordes commaundment. Niniue was a greate citie vn to god/ conteyninge .iij.
dayes iourney.

¶ And Ionas went to & entred in to [the] citie euen a dayes iourney/
and cried sayenge: There shall not passe .xl. dayes but Niniue shalbe
ouerthrowen.

¶ And the people of Niniue beleued God/ and proclaymed fastynge/ and
arayed them selues in sackcloth/ as well the greate as the small of
them.

¶ And [the] tydinges came vn to the kinge of Niniue/ which arose out of
his sete/ and did his apparell of & put on sackcloth/ & sate him downe in
asshes. And it was cried and commaunded in Niniue by [the] auctorite of
[the] kinge and of his lordes sayenge: se that nether man or beest/ oxe or
shepe tast ought at al/ & that they nether fede or drinke water.

¶ And they put on sackcloth both man and beest/ & cried vn to God
mightily/ and turned euery man from his weked waye/ and from doenge wronge
in which they were acustomed/ sayenge: who can tell whether god will
turne & repent/ & cease from his fearce wrathe/ that we perish not? And
when god saw theyr workes/ how they turned from theyr weked wayes/ he
repented on [the] euell which he sayd he wold doo vn to them/ and dyd it
not.


¶ The .iiij. Chapter.

Wherfore Ionas was sore discontent and angre. And he prayed vn to the
lorde and sayd: O lord/ was not this my sayenge when I was yet in my
contre? And therfore I hasted rather to fle to Tharsis: for I knew well
ynough that thou wast a mercifull god/ ful of compassion/ long yer thou
be angre and of great mercie and repentest when thou art come to take
punishment. Now therfore take my life from me/ for I had leuer dye then
liue. And the lorde said vn to Ionas/ art thou so angrie?

¶ And Ionas gate him out of the citie and sate him downe on the est syde
theroffe/ and made him there a bothe and sate thervnder in the shadowe/
till he might se what shuld chaunce vn to the citie.

¶ And [the] lorde prepared as it were a wild vine which sprange vp ouer
Ionas/ that he might haue shadowe ouer his heed/ to deliuer him out of
his payne. And Ionas was exceadynge glad of the wild vine.

¶ And the lorde ordeyned a worme agenst the springe of [the] morow
morninge which smote the wild vine/ that it wethered awaye. And assone as
the sonne was vpp/ God prepared a feruent eest winde: so that [the]
sonne bete ouer the heed of Ionas/ that he fainted agayne and wished vn
to hys soule that he might dye/ and sayd/ it is better for me to dye
then to liue.

¶ And god sayd vn to Ionas/ art thou so angre for thy wild vine? And he
sayde/ I am angrie a goode/ even on to the deeth. And the lorde sayde/
thou hast compassion on a wild vine/ wheron thou bestoweddest no laboure
ner madest it growe/ which sprange vp in one night and perished in a
nother: and shuld not I haue compassion on Niniue that greate citie/
wherin there is a multitude of people/ euen aboue an hundred thousande
that know not theyr right hand from the lyfte/ besydes moch catell?

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
