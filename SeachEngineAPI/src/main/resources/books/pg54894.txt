                James Gordon Bennett and Fanny Elssler.


                            FANNY’S PARLOR.

_Bennett_ (Softly knocks)—Fanny, dear, are you in?

_Fanny_—Who’s there?

_Bennett_—Thy friend.

_Fanny_—Thy name?

_Bennett_—James Gordon Bennett.

_Fanny_—Gracious Heaven! (She unlocks the door.)

                             ENTER BENNETT.

_Bennett_—Good morning, sweet Fanny.

_Fanny_—A kind salutation to my noble friend.

_Bennett_—Where’s Wyckoff?

_Fanny_—I don’t know.

_Bennett_—Will he return soon?

_Fanny_—I guess not.

_Bennett_—Then come and sit in my lap.

_Fanny_—I will. (She bounds to Bennett’s knees.)

_Bennett_—Now kiss me.

_Fanny_—There! (Smack! smack! smack! and the last on his lips.)

_Bennett_—O! how sweet!

_Fanny_ (archly)—You don’t say!

_Bennett_—Yes, I do.

_Fanny_—And so do I.

_Bennett_—Then give me another cluster of kisses.

_Fanny_—I’ll give you a dozen or a hundred, if you will only _puff_ me
well, and fill the theatre every night.

_Bennett_—Have I not _puffed_ you well, my darling?

_Fanny_—W-e-l-l—y-e-s. Wyckoff says I am _increasing my popularity_
every day. And now if you will only continue to _puff_ me, my dear Mr.
Bennett, I will hug and kiss you, and love you ever so dearly. And do
you know that I intend to give your beautiful wife some precious jewels?

_Bennett_—Wyckoff said you contemplated a splendid donation to my fair
lady.

_Fanny_—O yes, dear Mr. Bennett, the jewels are all purchased, and your
dear wife shall have them soon.

_Bennett_—Hush! fair creature! Don’t talk so loudly. Is the door locked?
I hear footsteps. Some one ascends the stairs. If you are seen in my
lap, old Mordecah M. Noah will get hold of it, and put it in his Caudle
Lectures, which bite me terribly.

_Fanny_—The door is locked, and you need not be afraid, as it is only
the servant coming to bring me some wine and water, and to dust my
parlor.

_Bennett_—Well, give me one more fervent kiss, and let in the servant,
and I will depart, and return soon, unless you expect Wyckoff. It won’t
do for us both to be here at the same time, you know, eh?

_Fanny_—I hardly think it will, although I love you both.

_Servant_—(Knocks.)

_Fanny_—Busy! (Servant goes down stairs.)

_Bennett_—Which do you love best—me or Wyckoff?

_Fanny_—I love you the best, dear Mr. Bennett. Most people call Wyckoff
the handsomest, but I think you are the prettiest man I ever saw. Your
voice is so sweet, and your complexion so fair, and your features so
Grecian, and your smile so lovely, and your heart so kind, and your
figure so commanding, and your eyes so expressive of a large humanity.
O, Mr. Bennett, I most dearly love you, and now I desire to know if you
love me, and how much? And before you tell me, there’s another luscious
kiss on your fragrant lips. And now, dear friend, do tell me how much
you love your grateful and affectionate Fanny?

_Bennett_—O, I love you most ardently, and I have a mind to give Wyckoff
a touch of the Italian, and marry you, and hide ourselves in some deep
mountain glen of my beloved Scotland.

_Fanny_—O, if you would only do all that.

_Bennett_—What! kill Wyckoff, and marry you, and desert my devoted wife
and child?

_Fanny_—To be sure. Did you not say you would?

_Bennett_—O Heaven! Fanny! I am very nervous. Your extraordinary
fascinations will ruin me, and I must fly.

_Fanny_—Whither?

_Bennett_—To my office.

_Fanny_—What! Havn’t you the pluck to kill Wyckoff, and marry me, and
all my jewels, and the vast possessions I have acquired through my grace
and agility?

_Bennett_—Darm it, Fanny, no more to-day. Give me a parting kiss, and I
will go, and we will resume this delightful theme to-morrow, when
Wyckoff is promenading Broadway, or arranging your affairs at the
Theatre and the printing offices. So, good-by, my adored Fanny—farewell,
my precious solace and incomparable divinity.

_Fanny_—A fond adieu, my charming admirer. Come again to-morrow, or I
shall die. (She cries like a female Crocodile.)

_Bennett_—Farewell.

_Fanny_—Farewell—my benefactor. O farewell!

(He goes, and Fanny leaps, and dances, and laughs, and screams, and
wildly rejoices over his departure.)

         _The reader must now imagine the lapse of many years._

                           BENNETT’S OFFICE.

_Bennett_—Mr. Hudson, don’t let Ross & Tousey have any more _Heralds_
for their country agents.

_Hudson_—Why?

_Bennett_—Because I learn that they have got all my little private
arrangements with Fanny Elssler stereotyped, and intend to publish my
connection and black mail operations with Elssler and Wyckoff, which
will mortify me extremely, and forever degrade me in the eyes of the
people, and of my wife and children.

_Hudson_—I will see that Ross & Tousey obtain no more _Heralds_.

_Bennett_—Give the order immediately, to expel Ross & Tousey forever
from our establishment.

_Hudson_—I will. (Rings the bell.)

                      ENTER PAPER SUPERINTENDENT.

_Superintendent_—What is your desire, Mr. Hudson?

_Hudson_—Let Ross & Tousey have no more _Heralds_. They have offended
Mr. Bennett.

_Superintendent_—Is it possible? I’ll see that they get no more
_Heralds_. (He goes.)

               (_Hudson goes to Bennett’s private room._)

_Hudson_—I have given your order, and it will be instantly obeyed.

_Bennett_—That will suffice. (Hudson retires.)

                           (To be continued.)

                  ------------------------------------




     Richard B. Connolly and other Conspirators against my Liberty.


In 1855, Richard B. Connolly said he would give me a clerkship in the
County Clerk’s Office, if I would not expose his unnaturalized alienage.
I declined his infamous proposition. He then got Alderman John Kelly to
read a letter to the Board of Aldermen, declaring that he was born in
Ireland, and first landed in Philadelphia, where he got naturalized in
Independence Hall, and that he valued the frame that contained the
evidences of his naturalization, more than any piece of furniture in his
house, and invited all to call at his residence, and behold its graceful
suspension on his parlor wall. I called, and his wife assured me that
her husband was absent, and that his naturalization papers were in a
trunk, and that he had got the key. Alderman John H. Briggs called, when
Connolly was at home, but he was not permitted to see the evidences of
his naturalization. Other citizens, and many of Connolly’s most intimate
friends called and desired to see his naturalization papers, but he
declined to show them. I then went to Philadelphia, and got certificates
from the clerks of all the Courts, that Richard B. Connolly, of Ireland,
was never naturalized in the Philadelphia Courts, and I returned, and
published the results of my visit to Philadelphia in the _New York
Times_, and other journals, and also stated that Connolly strove to
bribe me not to expose his alienage. At the election of County Clerk,
which followed these events, Connolly did not vote, and when taunted
with his refusal to vote by his adversaries, he excused himself on the
ground that he had bet largely on several candidates, and dared not
vote. This was the very small aperture through which he crawled. And
this is the scamp who is to impannel the jury by which I am soon to be
tried for the alleged libel of Tiemann and Cooper and Connolly’s most
sacred friend, Simeon Draper, with whom he was long a clerk, and with
whom he has been connected in schemes of plunder and political villainy
for nearly a quarter of a century. From Connolly’s notorious character
as a sly and cunning and treacherous rascal, and Jury Packer, and ballot
stuffer, and public robber, I have every reason to believe that he will
pack the jury that will try me. And he has four powerful motives for
packing my jury, and sending me to Blackwell’s Island: And firstly, to
avenge my exposure of his perjured alienage, and secondly, to prove his
fidelity to his old friend, Simeon Draper, and thirdly, to win the favor
of Tiemann and Cooper, and secure their support of him as Comptroller,
and fourthly, to incarcerate me while he seeks his nomination and
election as Comptroller, so that I cannot expose his perjured alienage
and nefarious crimes, during his efforts to obtain an office, which will
enable him to steal millions from the Treasury, and thus rob the toiling
millions of their bread and raiment and shelter from the pitiless
elements, and drive many a lovely virgin, of sick and indigent parents,
to the horrors of prostitution. In 1852, he was almost penniless, but
now he is worth a million of dollars, which he has stolen directly from
the pockets of the honest and laborious classes, for whom he professes
exhaustless love. With the Mayor and nearly all the Executive
Departments, and Connolly, Draper, Sickles, Hart, and the _Herald_,
_Times_, and _Tribune_, and other journals, and Peter Cooper, and
Ex-Mayor Kingsland, and other millionaires against me, it seems almost
impossible to escape a sojourn at Blackwell’s Island, but I have
confidence in God and truth and justice, and I defy all the powers of
earth to vanquish my soul. And I most fervently thank the Great Disposer
of Events, that if I am consigned to a felon’s cell, it will not be for
robbing the friendless multitudes, like such thieves as Tiemann, Cooper,
Draper, and Connolly, who may not be incarcerated and tortured for their
deeds of villainy while living, although a terrible retribution awaits
them beyond the grave. Stephen, of old, was stoned for his virtues, and
Socrates poisoned, and the Saviour crucified, and a poor, humble, and
friendless being like me, may be imprisoned, and forced to die in a
dungeon, for exposing the public robbers of the present generation. But
I will not murmur at the terrible ordeal through which I am about to
pass. For my fidelity to the people, I may lose my liberty. Be it so.
And when the public thieves have consigned me to a lonely and dreary
cell, and my frail form slowly wastes away, and I am forever gone, my
absent soul will only crave a humble mound, and the tears of the
virtuous, to bless and fertilise the pretty flowers that prance over my
grassy hillock, in the mild summer perfume.

                               My Trial.


Mr. Sedgwick informs me that I will be tried on the first Monday in
August. I shall be ready, and I dare Mayor Tiemann to meet me on that
memorable day. It grieves me to know that my witnesses will overwhelm
him with disgrace, because his wife and children will be degraded
through all their posterity. But for Tiemann, and Peter Cooper, and
Edward Cooper, I have no sympathy, because they have been recreant to
the people, in their appointment of thieves and assassins to the most
lucrative and honorable offices. Daniel F. Tiemann has been a hypocrite
and a public thief, since he was Alderman in 1838. Peter Cooper has been
a public plunderer since he was Alderman in 1828, and a heartless miser
through all his days; and Daniel and Peter are training young Edward to
imitate their pernicious example. Peter Cooper is the father of
illegitimate children, who reside in the vicinity of his Glue Factory,
at Bushwick, and Daniel F. Tiemann has long kept a mistress on Randall’s
Island, and committed other deeds of hell, as I will prove on the first
Monday in August. Let there be no postponement of the trial, as I yearn
for a conflict, that will consign the foes of the people to undying
infamy.

                  ------------------------------------




                         National Degeneration!


What a consummate band of scamps wield the destinies of this nation.
From President to Treasurer, and Collector, and official Sexton, all is
black-mail, fornication, ballot-stuffing, and unblushing robbery. Who
can respect a President, who will permit such a villain as James Gordon
Bennett to be a guest at his table, and dictate his domestic and foreign
appointments, and demand the publication of the “List of Letters” in his
chameleon and most infamous Journal, to the exclusion of the _New York
Sun_, which has the highest city circulation, and which should publish
the Letters according to the Acts of Congress. Did not Bennett first
support George Law, and then Fremont, down to the last hour of the
election? And did he not traduce Buchanan, as no other man in America?
And why does Buchanan kiss the rod that strove to smite him? And why
does he permit him to visit the White House, as his most distinguished
guest? Is it because he fears he will expose the motive of his intimate
relations with Daniel E. Sickles, and give some curious reminiscences of
Fanny White’s notorious tour in Europe, while Dan was his Private
Secretary and flying Minister to Spain? Ostensibly, it was Buchanan’s
fear of Bennett’s hostility to his Kansas views, but in reality, it was
his dread of Bennett’s disclosure of hellish domestic events, during
Fanny White’s European pilgrimage, that induced Buchanan to proffer
Bennett the freedom of the White House, and that forced him to unite
Bennett and Sickles in perpetual friendship. I can show where Bennett
squints at Dan and Fan and Buck in the _Herald_, which shook the White
House to its deep foundation. Two famous harlots long kept Daniel E.
Sickles and Emanuel B. Hart, and the latter lives with a woman now, on
the principles of Turkish Free Love. Fanny White kept Sickles until he
went to board with a dancing master, whose wife he soon allures from the
bed of her husband, and drives him from his own house. He then seduces
their daughter, a mere child, who became six month’s pregnant. He now
fears the law, and gets Bishop Hughes to marry him to the lovely and
youthful creature of his seduction. He then introduces Mayor Ambrose C.
Kingsland to his wife’s mother, with whom Kingsland has sexual
intercourse. He then asks Mayor Kingsland to give him a certificate,
that he had been married six months before, to cover the pregnancy of
his wife. Kingsland hesitates, when Dan threatens to expose his sexual
intercourse with his wife’s mother. Kingsland becomes alarmed and gives
Dan the marriage certificate, and all is tranquil. When Dan became James
Buchanan’s Private Secretary, at the Court of St. James, Fanny White
visited London, and was very intimate with Buchanan, and Dan gave her
passports all over Europe, as Mrs. James Gordon Bennett. Bennett
ascertained this, and hence the long and bitter quarrel between Dan and
Bennett. Dan got the Hon. John Wheeler to give Fanny White letters of
introduction to certain parties at Niagara Falls, as Mrs. James Gordon
Bennett. Fanny White now lives in New York, and Dan is still friendly
with her, although she is kept by another. Emanuel B. Hart was long kept
by Eliza Pratt, who got tired of him, and discarded him. He subsequently
took a notorious wanton, named Louise Wallace, from a house of ill-fame,
and lives with her now, and introduces her into the first circles of
society. Sickles is now a member of Congress, and the most influential
man under Buchanan in the White House, and Hart was appointed by
Buchanan, Surveyor of the Port of New York, which is considered next in
importance to the office of Collector. And yet there are no earthquakes.
And the people tamely submit to this monstrous degradation. And these
revelations may lead to a scuffle of death between Sickles, Hart, and
myself. But if I were sure that my brains were to be strewn upon the
pavement, I would disclose to the American people, that their public
servants are thieves, and fornicators, and ballot-stuffers, and
black-mailers. Public men who will keep vile women, or (what is
infinitely more degrading,) be kept and fed and clothed by concubines,
like Hart and Sickles, should be exposed and loathed by all virtuous
minds. And Buchanan should be more despised than Hart and Sickles, for
his known intimacy with them for years, and with Fanny White, and for
his appointment of Hart as Surveyor, and for chopping off the heads of a
hundred worthy officials, at the instigation of such a notorious rake,
and thief, and ballot-stuffer as Daniel E. Sickles. Buchanan fears
Sickles, Hart, Bennett, and Fanny White! God of Heaven! How the national
morals have degenerated during the present century. At a recent dinner
at the White House sat the President, Bennett, Russell, Hart and
Sickles. The President sat beside Mrs. Dan Sickles—Bennett sat next to
Mrs. Judge Russell—Russell sat alone—Emanuel B. Hart sat next to his
Mistress, and Sickles next to Fanny White. What a mournful sacrilege!
Violated shades of Washington! Jefferson! and Jackson! O Vernon! and
Monticello! and the Hermitage! may thy hallowed verdure be forever green
and fragrant. And paralysed be the monsters who trample thy mounds, and
blight thy pretty violets. And is there an American, or a naturalized
foreigner whose cheeks do not crimson at a bacchanal like this, in the
sacred atmosphere of great Washington’s mausoleum? What! Shall a gang
like this be permitted to desecrate the halls and seats once occupied by
the most illustrious patriots that ever graced the earth? O, Father of
Heaven! Do not abandon the honest Americans, nor the patriot pilgrims to
these happy shores, who still are grateful for Thy protection of their
immortal Fathers, and who will strive to elect men to wield their
destinies, who cherish Thee, and will legislate for the honor and
welfare and glory of their beloved country. Do not desert them, O God!
is the fervent prayer of millions of noble Americans, and of all
naturalized foreigners, who truly love Thee, and the free and sunny land
of their adoption.

                  ------------------------------------




Does Mayor Tiemann know what became of the Lime Kiln Man? Most horrible
           disclosures! In God’s name, where are the People?


William O. Webb, now Superintendent of Potter’s Field, who was appointed
by the Ten Governors, sold and delivered last winter, five hundred
corpses to the body snatchers, and has sold about the same number for
several winters past, for which he and others received $17 for each
corpse, forming an aggregate of $8,500 that was received each winter.
The bodies are disinterred in the night, during the favorable tides, and
carried from Potter’s Field to the Dead House, on the shore of Ward’s
Island,—sometimes in a sleigh, and sometimes in a wheelbarrow,—and
delivered to the body snatchers, awaiting their arrival at the Dead
House. William O. Webb directs the grave diggers to give no corpses to
the body snatchers, who died of small pox, or other contagious diseases,
nor badly mutilated bodies. Michael Gilmore was an Assistant Grave
Digger, and is now a clerk of the Superintendent of Potter’s Field. Wm.
O. Webb’s salary is $800 per annum—a house free of rent—a farm—fuel, and
provisions, from the Ten Governors—and four paupers and a servant to
manage his farm. Sometimes he has fifteen paupers to work his farm.
Webb’s clerk receives $400 a year, and his wife $200, and they have a
large house and extensive grounds, and a servant and fuel and provisions
from the Ten Governors. Webb employs a boy, about sixteen years old, who
buries the dead, and who has $300 per annum. This boy receives the dead
bodies, and selects such as the Doctors desire, immediately on their
reception at Potter’s Field. Sometimes an arm or a leg is dissevered,
and sold to the Doctors. After the bodies are removed, the coffins are
sawed and chopped, and packed in bags, and taken to Harlem, and used as
fire wood. The bodies are stripped of their dead clothes, and the best
part sold in the city, as apparel, and the residue as rags, which
constantly exposes the city to contagion. The Ten Governors are familiar
with these facts, and have some knowledge of what is done with the money
that is received for the dead bodies. William O. Webb has long been the
warm personal and political friend of Governor Daniel F. Tiemann, whose
mutual relations have been of such a _peculiar nature_ that, although
Gov. Tiemann has often been apprised of Webb’s monstrous proceedings,
yet he dared not advance a step towards his removal. Webb’s expenses as
Superintendent of Potter’s Field are $5,000 per annum. A respectable
man, with the best security, proposed to Mayor Tiemann, when he was
Governor, to assume the management of Potter’s Field, for $1,000 per
annum, without the salaries, houses, farms, paupers, and servants, fuel,
and provisions that the Superintendent and Clerk, and their wives then
and now receive, forming an aggregate of $5,000 per annum, exclusive of
the $8,500 received by the Superintendent and others for dead bodies.
And yet, such were the _peculiar relations_ subsisting between Gov.
Tiemann and Mr. Webb, that the former dared not accept a proposition so
favorable to the Treasury of the City, for whose economical
disbursements Gov. Tiemann professes such anxious regard. One of the
grave diggers refused to sell the body snatchers any more bodies, and
informed Gov. Tiemann of his determination, who exclaimed, with much
levity: “If you interfere with their business, there will be no inquest
held over your body.” Webb sold the corpse of his wife’s uncle, whose
name was Brown, a builder, and when Brown’s relatives desired his body
for respectable interment, Webb placed another corpse in the coffin, and
sent it to them, which they interred as their dear relative. The Lime
Kiln Man was borne to Potter’s Field, and when his friends heard the sad
intelligence of his death and pauper interment, they raised funds, which
they gave to Webb, with directions to exhume and respectably inter him.
But Webb could not find the Lime Kiln Man, and placed another corpse in
a coffin, and buried it, and when the friends of the Lime Kiln Man came
to Potter’s Field, Mr. Webb led them to a grave, which he assured them
was the Lime Kiln Man’s. At my trial, on the first Monday in August, I
shall summon the Doctor, and the body snatchers connected with him, and
the superintendent, clerk, grave diggers, and all others engaged in this
awful sacrilege, to unmask the scoundrels connected with our public
institutions.

                  ------------------------------------




                     Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.


New York is the seat of Commerce, affluence, intelligence, and
journalism, and the devil has placed at the head of the Press, three
such rogues as Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond. I have personally known
these desperate jugglers for twenty years, and if the reader is
sceptical, when I brand them as unparalleled scoundrels, let him refer
to the files of these editors, who fiercely denounce, and clearly prove
each other to be incomparable villains, and in parallel columns, they
assume to be the censors of the public morals, and anathematise rogues
of every grade and country, whom they strive to allure to the embraces
of the sacred virtues. The mighty destinies of our country are in the
grasp of heartless black mail editors, and Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond
never unite in matters of public good, nor in the election of
meritorious citizens to public office. And when they scream loudest for
the propagation of the public virtues, and the creation of wise public
measures, their eyes are fastened on the devil, and his imps, and
overshadowing schemes of public plunder. Their opinions have not half
the force and purity of the humblest citizens, and yet, like foreign
despots, they thrust their heresies into our skulls, and in connection
with officials, as infamous as themselves, (whom they elect,) they
trample our most sacred rights, and slyly appropriate the public
treasure, and violate all laws, human and divine, and from whose
editorial edicts there is no appeal. And thus the public evils of our
country flow from such polluted sources, as the _Herald_, _Times_, and
_Tribune_. If these three editors were as pure and patriotic as they
profess to be, they would unite in the advocation of honest men for
office, and discharge their thievish correspondents at Albany and
Washington, (who are in collusion with official robbers, by direction of
their employers,) and invariably oppose the election of vicious men to
office. Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond, and other editorial rogues, never
advocate the election of a man to office, without the pledge of a share
of his influence and spoils, which is the real source of our public
evils. They black mail on a scale of startling magnitude and boldness.
They watch, with ceaseless vigilance, for facilities to seize the pap
from the private and public purse. They level their fleetest and most
envenomed arrows at the subordinate municipal officers, Mayors,
Governors, National Collectors, Representatives, Senators, Cabinet
officers, and the President, himself, whom they force to yield to their
demands, or they spread terror into the camps of these public vultures.
Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond have obtained their prodigious power,
through the large number of fools that read their nonsense, and black
mail philippics. If these idiots would cease to read their vile and
selfish stuff, and patronise those editors who proclaim the truth, and
strive to promote the public welfare, such men as Bennett, Greeley, and
Raymond would soon become the paupers and loafers and scamps of twenty
years ago, when they had no place to lay their wicked skulls, nor credit
for a loaf of bread.

                  ------------------------------------




                      The Peter Cooper Institute!


In front of this sham Institute is painted, in blazing letters: “These
Stores, and the Story above to Let. Enquire in office, 2d story.” And
Peter might have advertised a portion of the stories above the two lower
stories, as he has rooms to let in every story of the building. Even
around the lecture room, in the second and third stories, he has
constructed small rooms to let to any adventurer who comes along. Such
was his avarice, and so greedy was he to gouge all the area he possibly
could from earth and Heaven, that he dug as far towards China as he
dared, and approached Heaven’s dome, until his architect warned him to
stop, lest the whole edifice tumble into one common ruin, so feeble was
the building’s foundation. And now, Peter Cooper! I demand you to
instantly surrender your right and that of your heirs, (including Mayor
Tiemann and Edward Cooper,) to the building known as the Cooper
Institute. You have made a great noise, for half a dozen years, about
your extraordinary philanthropy, and you have publicly proclaimed, a
thousand times, that you intended to give your “Art and Science” edifice
to the city, _entirely_ for educational purposes. And you have got its
tax of $8,000 reduced with this plea. And you have also got the Croton
water tax removed, although you have got a steam engine in the building.
And yet you still hold the property, in the name of yourself and heirs,
and from what I know of your penurious propensities, I could almost
swear that you never meant to give it to the city. Was not the building
publicly dedicated long since? And where are the three thousand pupils,
with green satchels, with whom we all expected to see the building teem?
There is more cheerfulness and utility in the deserts of Arabia, and the
classic ruins and crumbling desolations of the Ancient States, than in
the dismal and Shylock echoes of your bogus and uncomely structure. And
why do you still clutch it to your heart, like an expiring miser, his
miserable dross? And why did you so construct the building, as to render
it utterly inappropriate for students? You have told beggars, high and
low, for half a dozen years, that you could not give them a crum of
bread, because you were devoting all your surplus means to the
construction of the Cooper Institute. And now that it is erected, and
you have got all you desired, (and have toiled thirty years to achieve,)
in the election of Tiemann, your son-in-law, as Mayor, through your
specious and fallacious Philanthropy, and in the appointment of Edward
Cooper, your own son, as Street Commissioner, by Tiemann,—after you have
reached the goal of your miserly and ungodly ambition, and have got all
New York in your breeches pocket, I find you apply your fingers to your
infernal nose, and hurl defiance at the people, whom you have
bamboozled, and evince a disposition to forever hold the building over
which you have raised such a clatter for half a dozen years, and now
actually advertise the stores and rooms of nearly the entire edifice,
and of course, will put the rents in your yawning pockets, in the name
of the President and Board of Trustees of the immortal Cooper Institute,
which illustrious Chartered Body only comprises Peter Cooper! O Peter!
Peter! you are a consummate impostor, and all the people will soon
conceive you to be so, unless you instantly disgorge the property you
long promised to give them for educational purposes. And now, Peter, go
to the City Hall at once, and record the Institute in the name of the
people, who will ever bless you for your noble philanthropy.

Friday, June 18th, 1858, the following preamble and resolutions were
adopted:

Whereas, A large number of swine are kept in various portions of the
city; and whereas, it is the general practice of persons so keeping
swine, to boil offal and kitchen refuse and garbage, whereby a highly
offensive and dangerous nuisance is created, therefore, be it

Resolved, That this Board, of the Mayor and Commissioners of Health,

of a nuisance and detrimental to the public health, therefore, the City
Inspector be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to take, seize,
and remove from any and all places and premises, all and every swine
found or kept on any premises in any place in the city of New York
southerly of said street, and to cause all such swine to be removed to
the Public Pound, or other suitable place beyond the limits of the city
or northerly of said street, and to cause all premises or places
wherein, or on which, said swine may have been so found or kept, to be
thoroughly cleaned and purified as the City Inspector shall deem
necessary to secure the preservation of the public health, and that all
expenses incurred thereby constitute a lien on the lot, lots or premises
from which said nuisance shall have been abated or removed.

Resolved, That the foregoing resolutions shall take effect from and
after the first day of July next, and that public notice be given of the
same by publication in the Corporation papers to that date, and that
notice may be given to persons keeping swine by circulars delivered on
the premises, and that all violations of this order be prosecuted by the
proper legal authorities, on complaint from the City Inspector or his
officers.

                                        CITY INSPECTOR’S DEPARTMENT, }

may be kept, are hereby notified that the above resolutions will be

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
