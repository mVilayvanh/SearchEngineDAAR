                                   I
                               THE PEOPLE


Mewanee was a brave little Indian boy.

He lived in a forest of North America with his father and mother and his
baby brother.

There were many other Indian people who lived in the same forest, and
Mewanee’s father was chief of them all.

Mewanee was very proud to be the chief’s son, for the chief was always
the bravest of all the Indians of his tribe.

One day mother left Mewanee and baby brother in the forest at play,
while she went to work in the cornfield.

Baby brother was swinging in his cradle from the branches of the tall
cedar tree.

Mother had made this cradle from the bark of the linden tree. It was
lined with soft rushes so that baby might be quite comfortable as he lay
in it.

The little boy could not fall out of his queer cradle because he was
tied in by means of strong deer sinews.

At first baby brother seemed quite contented as the gentle wind rocked
the cradle to and fro.

He was interested in watching Mewanee as he ran about near by.

How tall and slender and straight Mewanee’s body was!

Mewanee had only a small piece of deer skin thrown about his
copper-colored body.

The wind tossed his coarse black hair about his face and shoulders as he
played.

Suddenly Mewanee stopped running and stood very still.

He looked intently at a little hare as it scampered about the trees.

Now the hare saw Mewanee. Playfully it approached him, then slyly turned
around and ran away as fast as its little legs could carry it.

Mewanee dashed after it, forgetting all about baby brother, who was
swinging in his linden cradle.

How lightly he ran and how swiftly!

His legs went as fast as the wind.

On and on scampered the hare, in and out among the trees, seeming to
enjoy the race.

Now it stopped, and Mewanee almost caught up to it.

Away it ran again, faster and faster.

Mewanee called to it by making sounds that hares understand, but the
little hare did not stop.

[Illustration: MEWANEE DASHED AFTER IT]

Again and again he called, but the hare ran on and on.

Mewanee sat down on the ground for a moment to rest.

The little hare ran deep into the forest and was soon lost from sight.

Suddenly Mewanee put his ear to the ground and listened.

Then he jumped up and ran toward his little brother.

Baby brother was crying because he had been left alone. He wished
Mewanee to play with him.

Mewanee shouted to his brother as he ran along.

He shouted again and again, for he wished baby brother to know that he
was coming.

Baby brother heard Mewanee’s call and stopped crying. He could not
answer Mewanee because he was only a baby and could not talk.

Mewanee soon reached the tree where baby brother’s cradle hung.

How nimbly he climbed the tall tree so that he might be very near his
brother!

[Illustration]

Mewanee peeped into the cradle and spoke to the little boy. Baby brother
smiled at Mewanee. His tiny face wrinkled all up and Mewanee could
hardly see his little black eyes.

Baby brother looked very much like Mewanee, but of course he was only a
baby, and Mewanee was a big boy nearly twelve years old.

What fun the two brothers had as they watched the little grey squirrels
frisk in and out among the branches of the very tree from which baby
brother’s cradle hung!

Mewanee gathered some nuts, and the little squirrels hopped about him
saying, “Chip, chip, chip! Please give us the nuts!”

How eagerly they took the nuts from Mewanee’s hand!

Then they sat up on their hind legs and nibbled the nuts with great
glee.

Baby brother laughed very merrily as he watched the dear little frisky
creatures.

The birds, too, sang happily from their nests in the tree-tops. They
seemed to be singing to Mewanee and baby brother.

Mewanee answered the song.

Indian people could talk to all the animals of the forest.

These two Indian boys were having a happy time together when their
mother came from the field.

She swung her tiny papoose on her back, and away they went, Mewanee,
mother and baby brother.

Mewanee’s mother was very strong. Indian women must be strong because
they have to do all of the hard work in the fields.

Mewanee’s mother looked like all of the other Indian women. She had long
black hair and copper-colored skin.

[Illustration: A MOCCASIN]

She had a light weight skin wound about her waist, for it was summer
time and she did not need the heavier fur skin which she wore in winter.

There were moccasins on her feet, and long chains of beads and shells
about her neck.

On and on they went, in and out among the trees, through the forest.

Mewanee wished to go more quickly, so he ran on ahead of his mother and
baby brother. He was very happy and gay as he ran onward.

Finally he reached the opening in the forest where were the many wigwams
which made the Indian village.

Mother and baby brother soon reached the village.

Father Sun was bidding them welcome as he shone so brightly from above.

Mother was very tired from her hard work in the field and her long walk,
so with her tiny papoose on her back she entered the wigwam.

Mewanee stayed outside to watch some of the Indian women at work near
by.

He asked if he might help them, but they laughed as they said, “You are
too young, Mewanee; you could not lift these heavy poles.”

[Illustration]




                                   II
                                THE HOME


Mewanee was interested in watching these two Indian women build a
wigwam. They had already set the poles in a circle in the earth and tied
them together at the top with strong deer sinews.

When Mewanee came up they were wrapping the skins about the poles.

There were twelve buffalo skins which had been dried in the sun and
sewed together very firmly.

How quickly they stretched the skins about the poles and fastened them
to the earth with strong pegs!

One woman drove the pegs into the earth with her stone axe while the
other woman held the skin.

Mewanee watched them lace up the front of the wigwam.

Of course they left an opening for the doorway.

They must have an opening at the top also.

Mewanee knew that they must put a flap over the opening in the top, for
the hole must be covered in case of rain and wind.

Smoke was coming from the opening in the chief’s wigwam.

[Illustration: MEWANEE’S WIGWAM]

Mewanee’s mother had built a fire in the hole, which was in the center
of the earth floor of their wigwam.

Mewanee saw the smoke and knew that his mother was cooking supper.

He rushed toward his own wigwam and quickly entered the doorway.

The chief’s wigwam had queer looking pictures painted all over the
outside. Every picture meant something to these Indian people.

They used the juice of wild berries and roots for paint.

When Mewanee entered the wigwam it was filled with smoke.

[Illustration: A STONE JAR]

Mewanee’s mother was cooking some deer meat in a large stone jar, which
she had placed on the fire.

Mewanee watched his mother stir the meat with a carved bone spoon.

[Illustration: MEWANEE WATCHED HIS MOTHER]

Then he wandered about the room looking at the axes, knives, spears,
warclubs, and bows and arrows which hung about the walls.

He picked up a tomahawk and showed it to baby brother who was hanging in
his cradle from a peg in one of the poles of the wigwam.

Baby brother smiled as Mewanee brandished the tomahawk about, just as he
had seen his father do.

[Illustration: A BASKET]

Mewanee loved to handle these weapons and he longed for the day to come
when he would be big and strong enough to use them. He had his own bow
and arrows now, but they were not so large as his father’s.

Mewanee peeped into the stone jars and rush baskets standing about.

Some of the jars were filled with corn, others with powdered deer and
buffalo meat. Mewanee was happy to see so much food.

Mewanee soon threw himself on one of the mats and stretched himself
before the fire.

He listened for his father’s footsteps which he could hear when a long
distance off.

Now Mewanee quickly jumped up and ran out of the wigwam.

He stood quite still and listened.

The beautiful blue river which ran along in front of the wigwam seemed
to call Mewanee to its banks.

Mewanee loved that great, blue, peaceful river and listened to its
silvery tones.

Often he would say, “O river, river, when shall I be big and strong and
brave like my father?”

And the river would answer, “Have patience, Mewanee. The day will come
when you will be chief of this whole tribe.”

Then Mewanee would raise up his arms and ask the Great Spirit for help,
that he might be strong and brave enough some day to take his father’s
place as chief of his tribe.




                                  III
                                THE HUNT


While Mewanee listened and waited, his father, the chief, approached.

The chief was big and brave and strong.

His copper-colored body had many strange pictures painted upon it.

His black hair hung about his neck and shoulders and was decorated with
many feathers.

A short skin skirt hung about his waist. His deer-skin moccasins made
his step very light and soft.

Mewanee also wore moccasins. His mother made them from buckskin and
sewed them together with a queer bone needle threaded with deer sinews.

[Illustration: A WAR CLUB]

In the winter the Indian people wore snowshoes and heavy fur skins over
their bodies.

Mewanee jumped up and down for joy when he saw his father. He was very
proud of being a chief’s son.

The chief carried his war club in his belt, and his bow and arrow in his
hand.

He had many scalp locks dangling from his belt.

These scalp locks showed that Mewanee’s father was a brave chief.
Indians took scalp locks from the heads of the people they killed,
because they thought that these showed their bravery.

Mewanee was very glad to see his father, who, he knew, had just come
home from the hunt.

He gave a loud shout when he saw the buffalo which some of the Indians
were bringing to the chief’s wigwam.

He looked at his father with great pride for he felt sure that the chief
had killed this splendid animal.

“How fine!” said Mewanee, as he and his father entered the wigwam.

Supper was ready and was quickly placed before the chief as he threw
himself upon a mat in one corner of the wigwam.

How fast the stewed meat, corn cakes and sassafras tea disappeared! The
chief used a gourd for a cup, and hollow pieces of tree trunk for
dishes.

It did not take him long to eat his supper because he ate very quickly.

Now the chief took out his long-stemmed pipe from his belt.

The tobacco he took from a skin bag which he also carried in his belt.

How quickly he filled the stone bowl of his pipe with the powdered
tobacco!

Then he rubbed together two pieces of flint. Oh! he lost the first
spark, but the second he caught with the thin piece of reed which he had
ready.

How contented he looked as he stretched himself lengthwise on the rug
and smoked his long pipe!

[Illustration: THE CHIEF’S PIPE]

The chief’s pipe was very beautiful.

The stem was wonderfully carved and was beautifully ornamented with
braids of porcupine quills and with beaks and tufts from woodpeckers’
heads.

Mewanee jumped up and looked eagerly at the fine buffalo which his
father had shot.

[Illustration: A SKIN SCRAPER]

He knew that the skin would make a fine warm covering for him next
winter. Mewanee’s mother would skin the buffalo with a sharp knife and
stretch the skin in the sun to dry.

Now that the chief had finished his supper, Mewanee, mother and baby
brother would eat.

Mewanee’s mother called to him and he hurried to the place his father
had just left.

[Illustration: BABY BROTHER’S CRADLE]

Mewanee was hungry and quickly ate the food which his mother put before
him. Baby brother awakened and wanted supper too. Mother took the cradle
from the peg and fed her little boy some of the corn cake which had been
left.

Suddenly the chief got up from his skin mat and rushed out of the
wigwam.

Mewanee rushed out also. He wondered why his father stood so silent and
looked anxiously toward a hill in the distance.

He stood by his father’s side and said nothing.

Now the chief put his ear to the ground and listened.

Indians could hear sounds miles away and they had very keen sight.

The evening was very still and peaceful. The gentle moon was just about
to peep from behind the clouds.

The chief jumped up very quickly. He was silent and serious.

Yet he looked and looked into the distance.

Mewanee too was very thoughtful; he was anxious to know why his father
seemed so worried.

[Illustration: “MY SON,” SAID THE CHIEF, “I FEAR OUR ENEMY.”]

At last he said, “What is the trouble, father? Why are you so silent and
grave?”

“My son,” said the chief, “I fear our enemy, the Indians who live beyond
that distant hill.

“May the Great Spirit protect and guard us from their wrath.”

Then he sent Mewanee into the wigwam, while the stars said, “Good night,
Mewanee, good night.”

[Illustration]




                                   IV
                               THE ENEMY


The chief gave a loud call.

This call was heard by all of the Indian people in the village, but only
the men responded to it because the women did not take part in warfare.

They came from all directions, running toward their chief.

How quickly they gathered the cedar logs and branches and lighted the
fire! Then they sat around the fire and listened to the chief who spoke
to them.

[Illustration: A FIRE DRILL]

They were very silent and grave because they knew that trouble was upon
them.

Suddenly they stretched their bodies face downward on the ground and
asked for help and strength from the Great Spirit.

Their chief had told them that he feared that the enemy might be upon
them at any moment. He had heard strange sounds in the distance which
told him that the enemy were astir. He thought it wise to send men to
the distant hill, which had an outlook over the surrounding country.

These watchers were to signal him by means of a fire on the top of the
hill. If the signal should be a bright light it would tell them that the
enemy was approaching, but if they saw smoke they would know that they
were safe from the attack for the night.

The Indians knew that if they were attacked that night, and if they were
not prepared for the attack, their whole village would be destroyed.

Others of the Indians stationed themselves here and there to keep watch.

[Illustration: AN ANTLER WAR CLUB]

Some of them in their birch-bark canoes watched from the river. How
gracefully they glided to and fro on the peaceful river!

The chief approached the camp fire and threw a cedar mat upon it.

He did this so that he might more easily see the signal fire from yonder
hill.

All was very quiet while the Indians waited patiently through the long
night.

The kindly moon and the tiny stars looked down upon them seeming to say,
“Be of good cheer. The Great Spirit will protect you.”

[Illustration: A WAR CLUB]

Through the long night they watched and waited. Silently they smoked
their long pipes while they looked anxiously toward the distant hill.

The river looked beautiful in the still night. What a terrible thing it
would be if the enemy should attack this peaceful village!

Suddenly in the early morning the chief gave a loud shout, as he raised
his arms to the Great Spirit. The signal from yonder hill had told him
that all danger from the enemy was passed.

The enemy was not approaching their village, but had gone in the
opposite direction.

Wearily the Indians wandered toward their wigwams.

The men from the river had been watching also. When they saw the smoke
they paddled toward the shore. How lightly and easily they pulled their
canoes up on the river bank!

These bark canoes were very light and strong. The Indians made their
canoes by stretching the bark from the birch tree over a frame of pine
wood. Then they fastened the bark to the frames with the roots of the
spruce tree.

[Illustration: HOW EASILY THEY PULLED THEIR CANOES UP ON THE BANK!]

Mewanee had a canoe of his own and loved to paddle along this beautiful,
bright, blue river.

One by one the Indian men entered their wigwams.

The chief was the last to leave. He still had fear of the enemy. Yet he
knew that for that night there was no danger. He wondered where the
enemy had gone, and if they had attacked another village.

At last all was quiet and this Indian village was at rest.

[Illustration: A WAR CLUB]




                                   V
                           THE FRIENDLY TRIBE


In the silence of the early morning came the distant sound of hoof
beats.

Louder and louder, nearer and nearer grew the sound.

Many Indians rushed from their wigwams, put their ears to the ground and
listened.

Nearer and nearer it came, while the Indians listened and waited.

Suddenly from the nearby forest dashed a beautiful black pony.

On the pony’s back sat an Indian youth about fifteen years old.

He sat tall and straight. His eyes were bright and shining.

He had only a small skin wound about his body, though the night was cool
and chilly.

Quickly he rode and at last reached the wigwam of the chief.

Then he leaped lightly to the ground and began talking in great
excitement.

He had been riding hard for many hours and was tired and worn.

But he carried an important message, and must lose no time in giving it.
He said, “Chief, the enemy is upon my people. My father, the chief of
his tribe, sent me to ask for your aid.

“Our tribe is not strong enough to ward off the attack of the enemy.

“I fear that the enemy has already burned our village and destroyed our
crops.”

The Indians at a signal from their chief collected about him.

They decided to go at once to the aid of this friendly tribe.

It did not take them long to get their war clubs and tomahawks. They
were always ready for battle.

Some rushed off in canoes. Others, headed by their chief and the youth,
jumped upon their horses and went galloping away as fast as the wind.

Still others remained at home to protect their village, fearing that the
enemy might come that way.

[Illustration: THEY GALLOPED AWAY AS FAST AS THE WIND]

On and on the Indians rushed through the forest, along the river edge.

The canoes skimmed along the surface of the water like birds in the air.

But alas! they were too late.

When the Indians reached the village of the friendly tribe they saw a
mass of flames. The enemy had gone after setting fire to all the
wigwams.

The Indian women were running about, their long black hair flowing in
the wind.

They were wringing their hands and calling on the Great Spirit for
mercy.

They carried their babies strapped to their backs while the older
children clung to their mothers, badly frightened.

The men simply stood and looked at their burning village.

[Illustration: A WAMPUM BELT]

They were grateful to the other Indian tribe even though it could do
nothing to help them.

These two tribes had sealed their friendship by means of a belt of
wampum.

Wampum, which was the only kind of money these Indian people knew, was
made from various colored shells shaped into beads and strung on deer
sinews. Some Indian tribes wore the strings of wampum wound about their
necks, while others wove them into strong belts of many colors.

When two tribes wished to seal their friendship they did so by giving a
wampum belt.

Mewanee’s father felt very sorry for these Indian people. Indeed they
were a very unhappy tribe of Indians. All of their wigwams were burned,
and all of their food gone.

As they collected about their chief, he told them that Mewanee’s father
had invited them to share his village until they could rebuild their
own.

So they set out toward the neighboring village. Most of them had to walk
because all of the horses and canoes had been destroyed by the fire.

Father Sun sent upon them his friendly light as they trudged along.

The birds chirped from the tree-tops. They seemed to understand that
these people were very sad.

At last, tired and footsore, they reached the village in which Mewanee
lived.

They were glad for a place to rest.

They threw themselves face downward upon the ground and gave thanks to
the Great Spirit for sending this friendly tribe to their aid.




                                   VI
                              THE COUNCIL


There was very little time for rest, for they must be ready to go into
the forest to kill the deer and bear.

They would need many skins and much food because they were such a large
party.

The women must go into the forest to cut poles for their wigwams.

Before starting on the hunt the chief called a council.

The council was opened by a prayer to the Great Spirit thanking him for
the safety of this friendly Indian tribe and asking that, with the help
of the Great Spirit, they might have a fine hunt. The Indian men smoked
their pipes in silence.

When the chief had finished speaking, the men arose and clasping hands,
they danced in a circle, chanting a song as they danced.

It was a song of sadness, to which their feet kept perfect time.

While the Indian men were in council the squaws were getting the food
ready for the hunt.

Many corn cakes must be made so that the men need not start out hungry.

How quickly they made the corn flour into a thick paste and pressed it
into cakes! Then they threw the cakes into boiling water.

[Illustration: A MORTAR FOR POUNDING CORN]

Mewanee was watching some of the women get the corn ready for flour.
They threw the ears of corn into the jar of boiling water. Then they
took out the ears of corn and easily pulled off the skin. Mewanee was
interested when they cut the kernels from the ear and put them in the
sun to dry.

[Illustration: A MORTAR]

In a few days these kernels would be ready to be pounded into flour.

Mewanee had seen his mother make corn flour. He loved to watch her put
the dry kernels in a hollow stone and pound them with another stone
until they were ground into a fine powder.

The men were ready for the hunt. They had their stone axes, bows and
skin quivers filled with arrows.

[Illustration: A STONE AXE]

Some of the Indians carried skin bags filled with roasted corn and
powdered buffalo meat, for they might be gone for several days.

Others carried bags filled with water, for they might not reach a spring
where they could get fresh water.

Mewanee watched the Indians set forth. He wished to join them in the
hunt, but he was too young.

Then he quietly stole toward the river. He carried his bow and quiver
bag with him.

His mother saw him go, but did not call him back. She wished her boy to
become brave and strong.

Mewanee loved to do the things his father did. He could take straight
aim, for he had used a bow and arrow ever since he was a little fellow.

When he was a little boy he used a tiny bow and short arrows, but as he
grew taller and stronger his father made him longer arrows.

Mewanee’s bow and arrows were made just like the chief’s.

The bow was made of hickory wood, with twisted buffalo sinews stretched
from end to end.

[Illustration: MEWANEE’S BOW]

The bow string was stretched so tightly that it caused the wood to bend
in a slight curve.

The arrows which Mewanee carried in his skin quiver bag were about two
feet long with a pointed piece of flint fastened securely at one end.

Mewanee reached the river and quickly pulled his canoe to the edge. It
was very light and Mewanee pulled it along quite easily.

How lightly he jumped into it and how swiftly he paddled down the river!

He knew where the beavers built their lodges not far down the stream.

[Illustration: A SNOWSHOE]

He should love to trap a beaver, but he knew that he must wait until
winter for that. He felt sure that his father would let him go beaver
hunting with him when the snow came.

Then he would wear his snowshoes and glide swiftly over the surface of
the snow.

For several hours Mewanee paddled on the beautiful, peaceful river. He
didn’t stop for rest, and he had no food with him.

Indian boys were taught that they must endure hunger and fatigue, so
Mewanee was not unhappy.

How quiet he was and how eagerly he looked first this way, then that!

Suddenly he crouched down in the bottom of the canoe. His eyes were just
on a level with the top edge of the side. His arms were extended to
shoot.

He was very quiet, for the flock of wild geese which he saw in the
distance would scatter if he made the least noise.

[Illustration: MEWANEE TOOK CAREFUL AIM]

How gracefully they glided over the surface of the water! Soon they
would be very near Mewanee.

He awaited their coming. He did not stir for he did not wish to disturb
them.

Now up he sprang, rested on one knee, and took careful aim.

First one arrow, then another and another skimmed through the air.

Each arrow had been carefully aimed, and Mewanee had three fine geese to
take home.

He felt that he had been able to help in providing food for the friendly
Indian tribe.

On his way home Mewanee stopped to call to the squirrels as they ran to
and fro on the river’s edge.

He talked to them as he threw them acorns which he found in his quiver
bag. He stopped to listen to the birds as they sang to him from their
nests in the trees.

Homeward he paddled. It was getting late, but Mewanee was not afraid.

It was twilight when Mewanee pulled his canoe up on the river bank and
walked toward his wigwam.

He was very happy indeed, that he had the three fine geese which he
carried over his shoulder.

Mewanee’s mother was waiting for him, and baby brother smiled a welcome.

Little brother was still in his linden cradle.

I am sure an American child would feel quite unhappy if he were bound in
a cradle so much of the time, but Indian babies became quite accustomed
to it. They must learn to endure pain and suffering. That was their
first lesson.

As soon as baby brother was old enough he would be allowed to run about
and care for himself.

Mewanee did not say that he was hungry but he was glad to eat the cakes
and maple syrup which his mother gave him.

She was pleased when she saw the wild geese which Mewanee had shot.

While Mewanee was eating his supper the men came home from the hunt.
They had decided to return to the village for the night and set out
again early the next morning.

Mewanee rushed out of the wigwam to see what they had brought as a
result of the hunt.

He wished also to show the geese which he had shot. He was most anxious
that his father, the chief, should see them.

Mewanee smiled when his father said, “My brave son!”

After supper the Indians sat about smoking.

They were silent and thoughtful.




                                  VII
                             IN THE FOREST


This Indian village was a very crowded one that night.

The squaws and children slept in the wigwams, while the Indian men
stretched themselves on the ground outside.

A few kept watch, for fear the enemy might return and destroy their
village.

The tiny stars twinkled brightly from the heavens.

The good moon sent her protecting light upon the village.

All was very peaceful, except for the hoots of the owls which sounded
through the forest.

The enemy did not return that night.

Early in the morning the Indians awoke after a good rest. They felt that
they must go out again in search of more food.

Some carried long spears with them, so that they might spear the fish.
Others went into the forest carrying their bows and quiver bags with
them.

The women, with their babies on their backs, started out to gather poles
for new wigwams. They must lose no time for winter was at hand, and
wigwams must be built before snow came.

[Illustration: WHAT SPORT THEY HAD, DIVING AND SWIMMING!]

While the women were busy and the men hunting and fishing, the children
gathered for games. Some of the boys ran to the river. What sport they
had diving and swimming!

Others jumped on their ponies and had a fine time racing.

How they did dash along, so fearless and brave!

Now one was ahead, now another!

How they laughed and shouted as they rode!

The ponies seemed to enjoy the race as much as the boys.

Some of the older boys were enjoying a game of javelins which they were
playing.

They had lined up on either side of the field.

One side had bone rings, and the other side long javelins.

Now one player threw a ring, and the opposite player tried to catch it
on his javelin.

Oh! the first player caught the other’s ring.

Now the next two players tried and one caught the other’s ring.

The third player didn’t take good aim and lost his partner’s ring. He
must give his javelin to the opposite side.

After all on one side have had a chance to catch the rings, the opposite
side will have a chance.

When both sides have tried, the side having more javelins will win the
game.

The boys had great fun as they played. They laughed and shouted and
danced for joy.

Mewanee grew tired of watching and wandered off into the forest. No one
noticed his going.

He had his bow and arrow with him.

He started off in the direction the hunters had taken earlier in the
day.

On and on he ran through the forest. He stopped to talk with the
chipmunks or to feed the squirrels as they leaped about the ground.

The birds flitted about him in great glee. They twittered and chirped
and flew about his shoulders.

Mewanee was very happy. He had no thought of fear. He loved the birds
and the wild animals of the forest and enjoyed being with them.

On and on he walked, into the dense forest.

As evening drew near he grew tired. He lay down under a tall pine tree
and was soon fast asleep.

He had been sleeping very soundly, when suddenly he was awakened by a
fierce howl.

He jumped up and looked about him!

Already he could see the flaming eyes of a wolf not far off.

Quickly he sprang to the pine tree and with one bound, started to climb
it.

Before even the swiftest wolf could reach him he was way up on the
topmost bough.

Poor Mewanee was badly frightened now. As he looked below he saw the
eyes of the hungry wolf glaring at him through the darkness.

How bright and terrible his eyes looked! Mewanee had never before been
so near a wolf.

The silvery moon looked down upon the little fellow, seeming to say, “Do
not fear. I will care for you.”

The soft wind whispered to Mewanee and told him to have no fear. Still
Mewanee was not comforted.

“O Great Spirit,” cried Mewanee, “protect me from this terrible wolf.”

[Illustration: MEWANEE’S QUIVER BAG]

Mewanee felt for his quiver bag. He had forgotten that he had laid his
bow and arrows under the tree.

He had no way of helping himself. He thought of his father and mother
and his dear little baby brother.

He knew that while he remained in the tree, the wolf could not reach
him.

He wondered if his father and the other Indians would return this way.

He did not know what to do. He did not dare to sleep for the wolf still
kept watch. Now and then the wolf gave a hungry howl and looked fiercely
at the little Indian boy sitting in the tree-top.

Hour after hour passed.

It was morning, and Father Sun was smiling at him with his kindly light.
Mewanee loved the great bright sun and talked to him as if he were his
father.

The Indian people believed that the wind, sun, moon, stars and thunder
were good spirits which helped them care for themselves and their lands.

Mewanee felt sure that if he were patient, help would come, but he was
so very tired that he did not know how much longer he could stay
crouched in the tree-top.

A wild blackbird sang to him from a branch near by. He said, “Fear not,
Mewanee; help is near at hand.”

Mewanee tried to be brave.

Suddenly all grew very dark within the forest.

Thunder rumbled in the distance.

Flash upon flash of lightning shot through the sky.

Mewanee crouched lower and lower.

He felt sure that the Great Spirit had answered his prayer by sending
the Thunder God to him.

As peal after peal resounded through the forest and flash upon flash
burst upon him, the wolf gave a deep, angry howl. Then he turned and
fled into the dense forest.

Mewanee heard him go and raised his arms in prayer.

Soon the sky became clear and the sun shone once more.

Mewanee slowly and cautiously climbed down the tree. He was stiff and
cold and hungry.

He threw himself face downward upon the ground and gave thanks to the
Great Spirit for his care.

He picked up his bow and quiver bag and ran, as fast as he could, toward
the opening. On and on he ran until he came to the edge of the forest,
when he could see his village.

His father and the other Indians had returned from the hunt. He saw them
going to and fro seeming troubled and anxious. The chief, his father,
sat watching and waiting.

Mewanee ran as fast as his tired legs would let him.

“Father, father!” he shouted.

The chief jumped up and clasped his son in his arms.

All of the Indians rushed toward them asking many questions.

When they heard the story they sang words of praise.

The chief led his son to the wigwam and bade the mother give him food
and drink.

“Rest well, my son,” he said, “for you have indeed been a brave boy. I
feel sure that you will be a fit warrior to take my place.

“We have had a fine hunt; you have returned unharmed; we can be at peace
once more.”




                                  VIII
                             THE SACRIFICE


It was evening, a beautiful starlight evening.

The tiny stars watched over these Indian people as they slept.

They were tired with the long chase, though they were happy with the
thought of the fine deer and buffalo which they had killed.

The Indians slept soundly all of the night. When they awoke the sun was
saying a bright “Good morning.”

[Illustration: SOME OF THE WOMEN STRETCHED SKINS WHILE OTHERS MADE
BASKETS]

They arose, stretched themselves and ran to the river for a swim.

The women were already busy getting the skins from the animals.

Some of the women stretched the skins in the sun to dry, while others
made baskets.

The Indian people dried meat in the sun and then powdered it. They
stored the powdered meat in baskets and jars for the winter.

The men spent nearly every day in hunting and fishing.

[Illustration: A MEAT POUNDER]

Mewanee came from his wigwam looking very unhappy and sad.

Baby brother was very ill.

His mother tried to soothe her baby boy with a low, sweet lullaby, and
Mewanee tried to quiet him by a soft chant. But baby brother would not
be quieted.

Mother gave him a drink made from wild roots, but this did not seem to
help the little fellow.

As the day passed, his fever grew stronger and fiercer.

When the chief came home and saw how sick baby brother was he said, “The
medicine man must be sent for. He will cure my son.”

The medicine man was thought to be very wise. The Indian people believed
that he could cure all sickness.

They thought that the power to cure was given to the medicine man by the
Great Spirit.

So the medicine man was sent for.

While they were waiting, the Indians built a fire and gathered about it.

They sang a mournful song to the Great Spirit. As they sang they made
strange gestures with their arms.

They thought that the chief’s son was ill because they had in some way
offended the Great Spirit.

They hoped in this way to appease the wrath of the Great Spirit.

Suddenly a queer looking old man rushed into the circle. He made all
sorts of strange noises and jumped up and down as he shouted.

This was the medicine man for whom the chief had sent.

He motioned the chief to bring his little son to him.

[Illustration: A CARVED BONE]

Then he ordered a jar filled with water to be placed on the fire. Now
the medicine man threw some herbs into the jar of water.

He danced and sang as he stirred the mixture with a carved bone which he
carried in a skin bag.

This bone was supposed to have a certain charm.

The chief came from the wigwam, carrying baby brother in his linden
cradle. As he came near, the medicine man raised his arms above the
baby, muttering low noises. Baby brother stopped crying and lay very
quiet.

[Illustration: THE MEDICINE MAN]

[Illustration: A WOODEN SPOON]

All the other Indians stretched themselves face downward on the ground,
praying to the Great Spirit that the chief’s baby might soon be well.

The medicine man gave baby brother a drink of the warm herbs. He used a
queerly shaped wooden spoon which was carved with figures of wild
animals.

Then bending low over the baby he whispered a soft song. His low tones
soon quieted the little boy. The baby’s eyelids drooped. In a moment he
had fallen fast asleep.

Mother came out and carried her little boy into the wigwam.

Then the medicine man spoke to the chief. He said that his son would not
be well until a sacrifice of a red deer should be made.

This sacrifice would ward off the anger of the Great Spirit.

Fortunately the Indian people had killed a red deer in their last hunt.
So the deer was brought toward the medicine man.

First the medicine man said a prayer over the body of the deer.

All joined in with low chants.

Finally the deer was carefully placed upon the fire amid the low
murmuring of all present.

Then the medicine man walked slowly away.

Mewanee had been waiting in the wigwam. He was very, very sad.

When his father told him that the medicine man had promised that baby
brother would soon be well, he smiled and looked glad again.

Before another sunrise the little fellow was much better, and his mother
sang a song of praise to the Great Spirit.




                                   IX
                                THE FAST


There was a new moon now and Mewanee was twelve years old. He would soon
go hunting and fishing with his father.

Some day he would be chief of his tribe, but not before he had proved
his power of endurance. He must prove this power by a long fast.

On this night when the new moon was looking down upon them, the Indians
had collected about the fire.

Mewanee was lying face downward upon the ground very near the fire.

The chief, his father, was standing above him with arms outstretched as
he said these words:

“My son, the time is at hand when you must go into the forest for your
long fast. You must prove to your people that you are brave and strong
and ready to try the test of fasting.

“My son must show that he is strong and courageous. You need have no
fear, for the Great Spirit will protect you.”

Then the Indians danced around Mewanee singing in a solemn chant.

[Illustration: THE CHIEF WAS STANDING WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED]

This was their way of saying, “Be brave. O chief’s son, be brave!”

Then the chief led his son into the dense forest and left him lying upon
the ground.

Mewanee had no fear, for was he not the chief’s son?

Each day his father went to him with words of cheer.

Though Mewanee’s heart was filled with courage, each morning found him
paler and weaker. Yet not once did he complain nor did he ask for food
or drink.

The great chief’s heart was filled with pity when on the tenth morning
he saw his son stretched pale and still at his feet.

[Illustration: “FAIL NOT, MY SON,” SAID THE CHIEF]

“Fail not, my son,” said the chief. “Only two days more, and you will go
home in the honor and glory of the brave.

“The Great Spirit will continue to protect you, and you will go home to
your people, the victor of a great battle.”

On the twelfth day the chief went into the forest having food and drink
for Mewanee.

Not a word was said. The chief looked at his son with the light of
gladness in his eyes. The fast was ended and his son was the victor.

With food and drink, strength returned and Mewanee was able to walk with
his father to his people.

As he walked through the forest the birds seemed to sing a song of
praise. The trees seemed to nod to him and to wish him well.

His people were awaiting his return and had prepared a feast of welcome
for him.

As Mewanee entered the village, by the side of his father, all were
singing and dancing. Some of the men rushed toward Mewanee and led him
into the center of the merrymaking.

Then there was singing, dancing, and feasting. These Indian people were
glad to honor the youth who would some day be their chief.

[Illustration]

                              THE NEW HOME


It was fall before the homes of the friendly tribe were done. All had
been busy getting ready for the winter. Now the wigwams were finished.

Mewanee’s father had divided his dried meat and corn with this friendly
tribe. He had also given them powdered tobacco. The Indian men would be
unhappy without tobacco for their long pipes.

The friendly tribe was very thankful to Mewanee’s father for his
kindness to them.

They were collected around the camp fire that night. The children and
women were in the wigwams. Only the men could take part in council.

All was hushed and silent, when suddenly the chief of the friendly tribe
arose and all of the other Indians of this tribe followed their chief.

They danced in and out, and up and down, making queer sounds. This was
their way of saying, “Thank you, O Indian Chief.”

Then they prayed words of thankfulness.

Getting up slowly, they took their places in the circle and pulled their
long pipes from their belts.

They lighted their pipes by catching sparks from the pipes of the other
Indian men, who had been smoking during the dance.

They were very silent, and sat smoking their pipes until the fire died
out.

Then slowly they arose and wandered toward their wigwams. The night was
very cold now so all must take shelter within the wigwams.

Early next morning the village was astir for it was the day of parting.

[Illustration: A CARRYING BASKET]

Children were running hither and thither. The Indian women were busy
collecting the things which they were to take with them.

Baby brother was toddling along, his hand in Mewanee’s. He was able to
walk now, and so need not be carried about in his cradle. He smiled at
Mewanee and looked very wise, as if he knew what it was all about.

Just as they were about to start, Mewanee’s father came out leading a
beautiful gray horse.

He approached the chief of the friendly tribe and motioned him to mount
the horse.

This the chief did.

Then with the chief riding at the head, the friendly tribe started
toward their home.

Father Sun sent his kindly light upon these people as they wandered
homeward.

Mewanee watched until he could see the friendly tribe no longer. He knew
they would be glad to be home again.

[Illustration: HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON THE RIVER’S BANK]

Then he wandered slowly toward the beautiful river, happy in the thought
that he was the chief’s son.

He stretched himself upon the river’s bank thinking of the time when he
should become chief of his tribe.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
